          <p>
          I became interested in this project out of a desire to find ways
          to recognize indigenous sovereignty over the lands my ancestors
          falsely claimed, and to promote indigenous voices and cultural
          expressions.
          I live in Rochester’s Nineteenth Ward, on land guaranteed by George
          Washington to the Seneca Nation under the Candandaigua Treaty of
          1794.  
          In my lifetime I hope to see the full restoration of the Seneca
          Nation's ancestral lands.
