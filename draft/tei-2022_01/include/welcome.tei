This project creates a space for sharing traditional music and dance of the Onöndowa’ga:’ (Seneca) Nation, one of the Six Nations of the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) Confederacy.
The project will feature video and audio recordings of Seneca Earth Songs (<foreign lang="see">yöëdza’ge:ka:’ gaë:nö’shö’</foreign>) in the context of traditional teaching and historical information.
For a full description of the project's goals, see the <ref type="internal" target="about.tei">proposal</ref>.
