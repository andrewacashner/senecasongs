    The Standing Quiver dance is always the first dance whenever Earth Songs are sung.
    It comes from the way Seneca villages would send out groups of men for hunting or combat.
    One leader would take his arrow and drive it into the ground.
    As he went around the village enlisting other men, they would drive their arrows in next to the leaders, resulting in a <q>standing quiver</q>.
    In the same way then, this dance calls everyone in the community to gather together and join in the dancing.
    </p>
    <p>
    The music imitates the actions: the leader calls out and the other singers respond.
    Sometimes their melody is the same as the leader's but more often there are two separate phrases, like a question and an answer.
    The singers and dancers maintain a steady, walking beat, which distinguishes this dance as a kind of stomp dance.
    The first song features short call-and-response pairs, each repeated multiple times.
    The same pattern continues in the other songs but the phrases tend to get longer as the song continues.
    </p>
    <p>
    According to oral tradition, originally each singer had his own song in this dance, reflecting his own style and personality.
    Hearing the Standing Quiver Dance now we can imagine a portrait of a whole team of hunters or warriors setting out, proud of themselves and enthusiastic to start their adventure together.
    </p>
    <p>
    The story about Standing Quiver mirrors the way that Bill was taught to learn long sets of songs.
    His teachers told him to picture a line of people coming before him, each to sing a different song.
    So when he thought of each new song in his mind, he pictures the next person coming forward.
    There is a close link, then, between memory and relationship, tradition and community.

    <blockquote>
      <p>
      So think about those guys paddling along, wearing their good clothes...
      maybe they’re going to trade somewhere, or going somewhere; maybe they're
      dressed for war—maybe that’s what they call it—but as they’re going
      along, they’re singing this.
      <strong>How cool is it to have history like that?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
      I think about music and ceremony and social dance that it’s a miracle
      that we have anything, because I know a lot of tribes don’t have that.
      [...]
      So to me it seems that all the stuff that happened in our past, 
      <strong>no matter what happened, they kept singing.</strong>
      [...]
      There was times when they didn't feel like singing and dancing, you
      know, but they kept going, and they kept it going. 
      They kept that ceremonial circle going.
      </p>
      <p>
      So to us, we look at it not as a job but as a responsibility, I guess,
      to pass it on, ’cause they didn’t let it go, so there’s a reason that
      they did that.
      And now, when I do that and sing that and everybody dances that, it’s
      like, <strong>it’s strong: we’re still here, and we celebrate that.</strong>
      So that’s what music is about for us.

      As with all Seneca social dances, the participants dance while singers sing a set of songs specific to that dance, accompanied with instruments.
      The lead singer selects which songs to include based on the time available and personal preference.
      In general for Seneca social dances, most songs last between one and two minutes, and it is common to select between ten and fifteen songs, making a full dance of fifteen minutes or more.
      In the version of Standing Quiver recorded by the Allegany Singers in 2002, Kyle Dowdy selected ten songs.
      The transcription is how Andrew hears this—which is to say, this is one interpretation, the result of a set of choices about what is important to record and show.
      </p>
      <p>
      <em class="seneca">Ga’da:šo:t</em> always begins with the first song in that recording.
      The leader and singers sing short phrases in a call-and-response (or antiphonal) pattern:
      <em>ah</em>/<em>hwih</em>, 
      <em>eyo’</em>/<em>hwe</em>, 
      <em>ahe’</em>/<em>ahe’</em>, 
      <em>wiha’</em>/<em>wiha’</em>, 
      <em>ë-ë’</em>/<em>ë-ë’</em>, 
      <em>hayo’/hayo’</em>.
      The whole set begins on a single pitch sung in a two-beat phrase (one beat for the call, one for the response).
      The first three phrases are sung on one pitch, approximately <aac:pitch pname="A" oct="4" /> in this recording.
      (The precise pitch level is not significant for Seneca singers and can vary across performances and even within a single song.)
      The next phrase dips down to a pitch just below the center and the following starts a half-step above it.
      </p>
      <p>
      Rhythmically, the song moves at a slow walking pace, accompanied with only a <em class="seneca">ga’sä:dö’</em> (frame drum).
      The drum player begins with slow beats that line up with the call and response, then (as in most Earth Songs) begins playing one subdivision below the main beat.
      In other words, if we would notate the singers’ phrases in quarter notes, the drum would be playing eighth notes.
      The alternation between leader and singers gives each phrase two parts, and those phrases might be heard as a larger metrical grouping, except that the length of the phrases is irregular.
      The song closes with a high-pitched exclamation, as does every song in this dance.
      </p>
      <p>
      After this introductory song, the remaining songs follow the pattern of song 2.
      The call-and-response pattern continues, now with longer phrases.
      The singers do not repeat the leader’s phrase but sing a separate response.
      The melody follows an ABABA form: A is the first antiphonal phrase (or two), repeated several times; and B is the one or two contrasting phrases that follow, usually with a higher pitch center.
      </p>
      <p>
      Song 5 provides a good example of the pattern that holds for most of the Standing Quiver songs
      (<aac:ref type="music" href="#mus:quiver-song5" />).
      The A phrase is a three-beat call (<em class="seneca">hogea:ne’</em>) 
      followed by a two-beat response (<em class="seneca">hodiganeye’</em>); this is repeated four times.
      <!-- TODO spelling with long a:? vs score lyrics -->
      The B phrase consists of two call/response pairs also 3 + 2 beat pattern.
      Melodically the lead singer in the A phrase emphasizes the notes below the tonal center, but switches to the notes above it in the B phrase.
      The other singers’ response emphasizes the tonic in the A phrase, then in the B phrase moves up one note and then returns.
      All of this is then repeated, though with one fewer repeat of the A (now three times), and then the A is repeated again with one repeat fewer again (now twice;

      <!-- TODO or just audio? -->
      <p>
      There is a general pattern that the number of pitches used and the length of phrases tends to expand from one song to the next, as well as the total length of each song with all repetitions included
      (<aac:ref type="diagram" href="#dia:quiver-lengths">diagram</aac:ref>).
      The length of the initial call of each call/response pair expands from one at the start to five beats in song 9, while the total length of the song expands.
      Where song 1 featured three pitches (A, B<aac:fl />, G<aac:sh />) and two-beat call-and-response groups (1-beat call + 1-beat response),
      song 2 features four pitches (A, B, C<aac:sh />, E) and four- and five-beat groups (the phrases group 2 + 2, 2 + 2, and 3 + 2).
      Song 3 features a different four pitches (A, B, D, E) and six-beat groups (3 + 3).
      </p>
      <xi:include href="diagram-quiver-lengths.xhtml" />
      <p>
      The pattern does not continue exactly, as for example in song 6 when groups are shortened to 2 + 1, with four pitches, but this only heightens the sense of progression when the pattern of expansion returns in the next songs.
      There are also variations in the pattern of subphrases: in songs 4, 7, and 8 only, the A phrase has two subphrases, and among these songs 7 and 8 compensate by having only one subphrase in the B phrase
      (<aac:ref type="table" href="#tab:quiver-phrase_groups">table</aac:ref>).
      </p>
      <xi:include href="table-quiver-phrase_groups.xhtml" />
      <p>
      Song 8 includes the most pitches (A, B, C<aac:sh />, D, E, F<aac:sh />) and song 9 has the longest phrases and the longest total length.
      But in a way this only heightens the sense of progression when in the next song, which features phrases of six and eight beats, and includes six pitches (A, B, C<aac:na />, D, E, and F<aac:sh />).
      </p>
      <p>
      The number of pitches also expands generally across the set 
      (<aac:ref type="table" href="#tab:quiver-pitches">table</aac:ref>).
      The total set of pitches is A, B<aac:fl />, B<aac:na />, C<aac:na />, C<aac:sh />, D, E, and F<aac:sh /> (<aac:pcset n="0 1 2 3 4 5 7 9" />).
      Most of the songs, though, emphasize A, B, C<aac:sh />, D, and E (<aac:pcset n="0 2 4 5 7" />).
      The tonal center throughout is on A as <aac:degree accid="sh" n="1" />.

      As in other Seneca Earth Songs, most of the words are vocables.
      Though meaningless, they are always sung the same way and are an integral part of each songs.
      Standing Quiver also includes some Seneca-language words.

    <p>
    The dance follows the story of a men recruiting a band to go out traveling from the village.
    The leader begins dancing with a shuffle step in a counterclockwise circle, and he is followed by pairs of men and women.
    As Bill explains, <q>even though the women aren’t going, they’re supporting their men</q>.

    Each song has an AB structure with an initial call-and-response, then a section that often starts with a higher pitch and then returns to the tonic.
    When the higher-pitched B section begins, the dancers turn and face the middle.
