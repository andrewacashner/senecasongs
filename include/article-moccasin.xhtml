    <em class="seneca">Gayó:waga:yöh</em> or Old Moccasin Dance is of the stomp-dance type.
    The cultural-thematic emphasis of this dance is on dancing itself.
    It is often sung at the beginning of a set of social-dance songs, just after <a href="quiver.html">Standing Quiver</a> (which is always the first). <!-- TODO true? -->
    This dance can also be used as a medicine ceremony as part of the Midwinter Ceremonies.

    <h1>Story</h1>
    <p>
    Bill’s grandfather tells a story about Moccasin Dance.
    One time in the old days they were having a Sing and someone had invited a white man that no one else knew.
    He listened and took lots of notes in his notebook.
    Years later Bill’s grandfather saw this white man in the news and realized he was Arthur Murray.
    He had invented the Charleston based on the Seneca Moccasin Dance.
    </p>
    <p>
    Written evidence indicates that the Charleston originated from dances in African-American communities of the early twentieth century
    <aac:citation key="Conyers:Charleston" />.
    It became famous after it first appeared on the Broadway stage in the 1923 musical <cite>Runnin’ Wild</cite> with words and music by prominent Black composers Cecil Mack and James P. Johnson
    <aac:citation key="CharlestonRoots" />.
    While the song and dance certainly descend from earlier Black dances, Mack and Johnson’s song emphasizes the song’s newness: it is <q>a new tune,/ Funny blue tune</q>, <q>Made in South Caroline</q>
    <aac:citation key="MackJohnson:Charleston" />.
    Johnson said he was inspired by the dance routines and ring-shout calls of Gullah Geechee dockworkers, and other accounts of the time suggest these dances were popularized by tours of the Charleston’s Jenkins Orphanage Band.
    Arthur Murray, for his part, was well-known at the same time as the owner of a successful dance-teaching franchise.
    He grew up in New York City, child of Jewish immigrants from Austria, and started his first dance studios in North Carolina
    <aac:citation key="ArthurMurrayObit" />.
    Arthur Murray certainly had nothing to do with creating the Charleston, and a Seneca connection seems extremely unlikely.

    <p>
    On the other hand: the vogue of <q>playing Indian</q> in white communities was at its height in the 1920s
    <aac:citation key="Deloria:PlayingIndian" />. <!-- TODO details -->
    The fashion trends embraced by <q>flappers</q> centered on unstructured, tunic-like dresses with long fringe, and headgear that often featured headbands.
    Feathered headdresses could still be seen as a holdover of Edwardian fashions from the preceding decades, some of which featured close-fitting hats with one or a few upright feathers
    <aac:citation key="EdwardianHats" />.
    These trends seem clearly inspired by Native American clothing as it was known then, and a Seneca observer could easily see the round-cap-with-feathers fashion as resembling a Seneca <em class="seneca">gasto:weh</em>
    (<aac:ref type="image" id="#img:Broadway-Rose" />).
    Some aspects of the Charleston also do parallel those of the Old Moccasin Dance. <!-- TODO which ones -->
    Even if this particular example was not appropriated from indigenous
    culture, so many other things before and since have been that it seems
    reasonable to look at another hot new trend in mainstream US culture and
    say, <q>hey, we made that!</q>
    Arthur Murray represented dance as a popular commercial enterprise and would therefore be an obvious target in a story about profiting from appropriation.

    <p>
    Of course, even in Bill’s story, the Charleston connection is presented as a guess, as is the link between the Charleston and <em class="seneca">Gayó:waga:yöh</em> specifically.
    Why would the teller think to connect these?
    What would this story do?
    One interpretation would be that it expresses a desire to acknowledge the indigenous roots of American popular culture, to see a Seneca contribution in the mainstream spotlight.
    The teller also assumes that there is a pattern in which white men visit the Seneca community, take things that they learned with them, and then profit from those things in the outside world without acknowledging the source.
    That pattern was well established by scholars going back through Fenton all the way to Morgan.
    The story also provides a reading of the Charleston in Seneca terms, highlighting the similarity of some aspects of the dance.

      <h2>Musical Structure</h2>
      <p>
      As is the case with other Earth Songs, the Moccasin Dance songs are quite distinct from each other but still suggest a strong family resemblance.
      They sound like they belong to the same dance even though there are different types of melodies and rhythms.
      The Moccasin Dance songs are more consistently diatonic, with most songs using six notes of the major scale (i.e., a major hexachord) and a few adding a <aac:degree accid="fl" n="7" />
      (<aac:ref type="table" href="#tab:moccasin-pitches" />).
      </p>
      <xi:include href="table-moccasin-pitches.xhtml" />
      <p>
      The lead singer introduces each song by singing the first phrase.
      Beyond that, though, these songs do not feature call-and-response; the singers continue in unison.
      The singers repeat each song once (that is, they sing it twice) and there are no other internal repeats.
      Most of the songs have three or four phrases; the phrases contrast but also echo each other, with small motives repeated or varied in subsquent phrases.
      There are several patterns of these phrases: the most common is that each phrase is different from the previous one (A B C or A B C D); in several other songs one of the phrases returns, often in a varied form (such as A B C C, A B B, A B C B, A A B B).

      <h2>Words</h2>
      <p>
      The last song in both recordings by the Allegany Singers features the Seneca word for moccasin, <em class="seneca">gayó:wah</em>.
      <!-- TODO check -->
      Other songs include vocable words like <em>gayoweh</em> that sound similar, but this may just be coincidence since variants of <em>gayowaneh</em> are among the most common vocables in Seneca songs.

      <h2>Versions</h2>
      <p>
      Bill’s teacher Avery Jimerson taught him always to begin <em class="seneca">Gayó:waga:yöh</em> with the same two songs, as heard on both Allegany Singers recordings.
      After that, Kyle Dowdy’s choices as lead in the earlier recording featured more songs that he had learned from singers on other territories, particularly Six Nations in Ontario.
      The song selection in the more recent recording (with Jacob Dowdy singing lead) are more traditional to <em class="seneca">Ohi:yo’</em>, according to Bill.
      </p>
      <p>
      The oldest known recordings of Seneca Earth Song include a version of Bill’s first Moccasin Dance song that is almost identical.
      It was sung by <strong class="TODO">a man</strong> of the Seneca-Cayuga reservation in Oklahoma, recorded by Canadian <strong class="TODO">anthropologist Maurice Barbeau in 1912.</strong>

    Moccasin Dance uses the same step as other stomp dances like Standing Quiver and others.
    <!-- TODO which -->
    Women and men are arranged in alternation (with a man at the front) and dancers step forward with the right foot and bounce on the ball of the foot.
    They then bring their left foot forward, bouncing on the balls of the feet.
    The step lines up with the main beat (quarter note in the transcription) and the bounce with the subdivision (eighth notes).
    That motion mirrors the way the horn rattle players bring the rattle down on each beat, while the subdivision sounds automatically from the internal motion of the beads.
