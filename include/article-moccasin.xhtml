    <em class="seneca">Gayó:waga:yöh</em> or Old Moccasin Dance is of the same type of dance as Fish Dance and Sharpen Stick Dance, in that it features pairs of men and women who dance facing each other as they move together around the circle.
    In the middle of each song, the members of each pair switch places with each other.
    Old Moccasin Dance can be sung on any normal social-dance occasion and at any point in the set.
    This dance can also be used as a medicine ceremony as part of the Midwinter Ceremonies.
    The cultural-thematic emphasis of this dance is on dancing itself.

    <h1>Story</h1>
    <p>
    Bill’s great-grandfather Richard Johnny-John used to tell a story about Moccasin Dance when he presented the dance in shows, and this story still gets repeated by other presenters.
    One time in the old days they were having a social at the old Coldspring Longhouse, and since it was open to the public and not far from the highway sometimes outsiders would sit in.
    (That longhouse was since flooded by the Kinzua Dam, in violation of federal treaty.)
    On this occasion there was a white man that no one else knew, there with his family.
    He listened and took lots of notes in his notebook.
    Years later Bill’s great-grandfather saw this white man in the news and realized he was Arthur Murray.
    He was doing the Charleston, which he said he invented.
    Bill’s grandfather realized he had based it on the Seneca Moccasin Dance.
    </p>
    <p>
    Written evidence indicates that the Charleston originated from dances in African-American communities of the early twentieth century
    <aac:citation key="Conyers:Charleston" />.
    It became famous after it first appeared on the Broadway stage in the 1923 musical <cite>Runnin’ Wild</cite> with words and music by prominent Black composers Cecil Mack and James P. Johnson
    <aac:citation key="CharlestonRoots" />.
    While the song and dance certainly descend from earlier Black dances (of the <q>Buck</q> and <q>Wing</q> varieties), Mack and Johnson’s song emphasizes the song’s newness: it is <q>a new tune,/ Funny blue tune</q>, <q>Made in South Caroline</q>
    <aac:citation key="MackJohnson:Charleston" />.
    Johnson said he was inspired by the dance routines and ring-shout calls of Gullah Geechee dockworkers, and other accounts of the time suggest these dances were popularized by tours of the Charleston’s Jenkins Orphanage Band.
    </p>
    <p>
    Arthur Murray, for his part, was well-known at the same time as the owner of a successful dance-teaching franchise.
    He grew up in New York City, child of Jewish immigrants from Austria, and started his first dance studios in North Carolina
    <aac:citation key="ArthurMurrayObit" />.
    Arthur Murray certainly had nothing to do with creating the Charleston, but he did much to popularize it.
    As he lived many years in the Hudson River Valley, he certainly may have passed through the Allegany Territory at some point, but the Seneca connection to the Charleston seems unlikely.

    On the other hand: the vogue of <q>playing Indian</q> in white communities was at its height in the 1920s
    <aac:citation key="Deloria:PlayingIndian" />. <!-- TODO details -->
    The fashion trends embraced by <q>flappers</q> centered on unstructured, tunic-like dresses with long fringe, and headgear that often featured headbands.
    Feathered headdresses could still be seen as a holdover of Edwardian fashions from the preceding decades, some of which featured close-fitting hats with one or a few upright feathers
    <aac:citation key="EdwardianHats" />.
    These trends seem clearly inspired by Native American clothing as it was known then, and a Seneca observer could easily see the round-cap-with-feathers fashion as resembling a Seneca <em class="seneca">gasto:weh</em>
    (<aac:ref type="image" id="#img:Broadway-Rose" />).

    <p>
    Some aspects of the Charleston also do parallel those of the Old Moccasin Dance:
    both are lively dances with repeated pulses on a single foot while the other foot is free to move, and both feature partners facing each other.
    You can, in fact, do the moves of Old Moccasin Dance to the music of the Charleston, and vice versa.
    (See <a class="internal" href="#sec:moccasin-movements">the section on the movements</a> below.)
    </p>
    <p>
    Even if this particular example was not appropriated from indigenous
    culture, then, so many other things before and since have been that it seems
    reasonable to look at another hot new trend in mainstream US culture and
    say, <q>hey, we made that!</q>
    Arthur Murray represented dance as a popular commercial enterprise and would therefore be an obvious target in a story about profiting from appropriation.

    <p>
    Of course, even in Bill’s story, the Charleston connection is presented as a guess, as is the link between the Charleston and <em class="seneca">Gayó:waga:yöh</em> specifically.
    Why would the teller think to connect these?
    What would this story do?
    One interpretation would be that it expresses a desire to acknowledge the indigenous roots of American popular culture, to see a Seneca contribution in the mainstream spotlight.
    The teller also assumes that there is a pattern in which white men visit the Seneca community, take things that they learned with them, and then profit from those things in the outside world without acknowledging the source.
    That pattern was well established by scholars going back through Fenton all the way to Morgan.
    The story also provides a reading of the Charleston in Seneca terms, highlighting the similarity of some aspects of the dance.
    </p>
    <p>
    Speaking of Lewis Henry Morgan, that nineteenth-century ethnographer singled out moccasins as the greatest type of footwear ever invented, one of few aspects of Native culture that he believed were superior to European civilization 
    <aac:citation key="Morgan:League" pages="359–360" />:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      The moccason [...] is preëminently an Indian invention, and one of the highest antiquity.
      It is true to nature in its adjustment to the foot, beautiful in its materials and finish, and durable as an article of apparel.
      It will compare favorably with the best single article for the protection and adornment of the foot ever invented, either in ancient or modern times.
      With the sanction of fashion, it would supersed among us a long list of similar inventions.
      Other nations have falled behind the Indian, in this one particular at least.
      The masses of the Romans wore the calceus ligneus, or wooden shoe; the masses of Germany and Ireland, and of many of the European nations, formerly wore the same.
      With the cothurnus and sandal of the ancients, and the boot of the moderns, the moccason admits of no unfavorable comparison. 
      It deserves to be classed among the highest articles of apparel ever invented, both in usefulness, durability, and beauty.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
    The Minnetonka Moccasin company, whose annual revenue in 2022 was <aac:usd />37.5 million, would seem to agree with Morgan.

      <h2>Musical Structure</h2>
      <p>
      As is the case with other Earth Songs, the Moccasin Dance songs are quite distinct from each other but still suggest a strong family resemblance.
      They sound like they belong to the same dance even though there are different types of melodies and rhythms.
      The Moccasin Dance songs are more consistently diatonic, with most songs using six notes of the major scale (i.e., a major hexachord) and a few adding a <aac:degree accid="fl" n="7" />
      (<aac:ref type="table" href="#tab:moccasin-pitches" />).
      </p>
      <xi:include href="table-moccasin-pitches.xhtml" />
      <p>
      The lead singer introduces each song by singing the first phrase.
      Beyond that, though, these songs do not feature call-and-response; the singers continue in unison.
      The singers repeat each song once (that is, they sing it twice) and there are no other internal repeats.
      Most of the songs have three or four phrases; the phrases contrast but also echo each other, with small motives repeated or varied in subsquent phrases.
      There are several patterns of these phrases: the most common is that each phrase is different from the previous one (A B C or A B C D); in several other songs one of the phrases returns, often in a varied form (such as A B C C, A B B, A B C B, A A B B).

      The last song in both recordings by the Allegany Singers features the Seneca word for moccasin, <em class="seneca">gayó:wah</em>.
      Other songs include vocable words like <em>gayoweh</em> that sound similar, but this may just be coincidence since variants of <em>gayowaneh</em> are among the most common vocables in Seneca songs.

      Bill’s teacher Avery Jimerson taught him always to begin <em class="seneca">Gayó:waga:yöh</em> with the same two songs, as heard on both Allegany Singers recordings.
      After that, Kyle Dowdy’s choices as lead in the earlier recording featured more songs that he had learned from singers on other territories, particularly Six Nations in Ontario.
      The song selection in the more recent recording (with Jacob Dowdy singing lead) are more traditional to <em class="seneca">Ohi:yo’</em>, according to Bill.

      <p>
      The oldest known recordings of Seneca Earth Song include a version of Bill’s first Moccasin Dance song that is almost identical.

    <!-- TODO music example of one song: label or discuss in text (1) lead intro, (2) first choral verse, (3) second choral verse  -->
    <p>
    Old Moccasin Dance starts with a circle of only men dancing counterclockwise as usual.
    Women line up and step into the circle in between the men, in the pattern female-male-male-female (so the first woman steps in front of the first man and the second woman steps behind the second man).
    In the middle of each song, the two members of each pair will switch places.
    Thus the head of the line at the start will be two couples arranged FM–MF; when they rotate it will become MF–FM; when they rotate again in the next song they will be back to FM–MF.
    </p>
    <p>
    Each song starts with an introduction by the lead singer, in relatively
    free rhythm, with the rattle shaking continuously; during the intro the
    dancers just walk forward at a free pace.
    Next the rest of the singers join in to sing the melody and the rattle and drum begin to play a regular beat, typically emphasizing the smaller rhythmic subdivision (eighth notes in the transcription;
    <aac:ref type="table" href="#tab:moccasin-steps" />).
    During this section, which we will call the first choral verse, the dancers begin to dance with a slow step, right–right, left–left, one step per beat (quarter note).
    When the singers repeat the melody, the rattle and drum shift to a <q>half-time</q> feel, emphasizing the main beat (quarter notes); we call this the second choral verse.
    </p>
    <xi:include href="table-moccasin-steps.xhtml" />
    <p>
    Now the second dancer in each pair moves ahead of their partner and turns around to face them.
    Men moving forward should go on the outside of the circle while women should go on the inside.
    The dancers shift to a faster step that includes a step and shuffle on the right foot, a quick change to the other and back, and ends with a longer step on the left
    (<aac:ref type="table" href="#tab:moccasin-steps" />).
    <!-- TODO video reference -->
    The rear-facing dancer does this step in reverse.
    When the song ends with <em>yo:ho:h</em>, the front dancer turns again to face forward and the dance repeats for the next song.
    </p>
    <p>
    The traditional last song features a special rhythm and a step to match: the dancers stop and hold their step for a quarter note
    on the words <em>yo:h ga:yowa:h</em>, while the rattle and drum also stop.
    </p>
    <p>
    The pattern of when to dance, when to rotate positions, and the basic steps are all prescribed, but within that this type of dance allows people freedom to move in their own ways.
    There is freedom and opportunity for creativity in moving the upper body and arms, and dancers can also do more complex variations on the basic step.
    </p>
    <p>
    Other than the traditional gender pairings, there are no restrictions on who can dance with whom in Old Moccasin Dance, and no one assigns any meaning to the pairings.
    The exact pairings of men and women results somewhat randomly from the way women line up and insert themselves into the circle of dancers, though Bill says some women have been known to time their entry just right to end up with someone in particular.
    Even then, however, this is not any kind of lovers’ dance, but an energetic, even athletic, dance of the whole community.
