    <em class="seneca">Gayó:waga:yöh</em> or Old Moccasin Dance is of the same type of dance as Fish Dance and Sharpen Stick Dance, in that it features pairs of men and women who dance facing each other as they move together around the circle.
    In the middle of each song, the members of each pair switch places with each other.
    Old Moccasin Dance can be sung on any normal social-dance occasion and at any point in the set.
    This dance can also be used as a medicine ceremony as part of the Midwinter Ceremonies.

    While some other Earth Songs are sung to give thanks for different birds (such as <a href="robin.html">Robin Dance</a>) or plants (<a href="corn.html">Corn Dance</a>), Old Moccasin Dance focuses on dancing itself.
    Since the Seneca Thanksgiving Address, <em class="seneca">Gano:nyök</em>, includes specific thanks for birds, corn, and other elements of the created world, it makes sense to think of dances like <em class="seneca">Gayó:waga:yöh</em> as embodying the first heading in the Thanksgiving Address, which gives thanks for <em class="seneca">ha’deögwe’da:geh</em>, the different kinds of people.

    <h1>Story</h1>
    <p>
    Bill’s great-grandfather Richard Johnny-John used to tell a story about Moccasin Dance when he presented the dance in shows, and other presenters still repeat this story.
    One time in the old days they were having a social at the old Coldspring Longhouse, and since it was open to the public and not far from the highway sometimes outsiders would sit in.
    On this occasion there was a white man that no one else knew, there with his family.
    He listened and took lots of notes in his notebook.
    Years later Bill’s great-grandfather saw this white man in the news and realized he was Arthur Murray.
    He was doing the Charleston, which he said he invented.
    Bill’s grandfather realized he had based it on the Seneca Moccasin Dance.
    </p>
    <p>
    Is there any chance that the Seneca Old Moccasin Dance influenced the Charleston?
    Oral accounts and documentary evidence from when the Charleston dance first emerged in the 1920s all point to an origin among African-American communities of the early twentieth century
    <aac:citation key="Conyers:Charleston" />.
    The Charleston became famous after it first appeared on the Broadway stage in the 1923 musical <cite>Runnin’ Wild</cite> with words and music by prominent Black composers Cecil Mack and James P. Johnson
    <aac:citation key="MackJohnson:Charleston" />.
    While the song and dance certainly descend from earlier Black dances (of the <q>Buck</q> and <q>Wing</q> varieties), Mack and Johnson’s song emphasizes the song’s newness: it is <q>a new tune,/ Funny blue tune</q>, <q>Made in South Caroline</q>.
    Johnson said he was inspired by the dance routines and ring-shout calls of Gullah Geechee dockworkers, and other accounts of the time suggest these dances were popularized by tours of the Charleston’s Jenkins Orphanage Band
    <aac:citation key="CharlestonRoots" />.
    </p>

    </figure>
    <p>
    What about Arthur Murray, then? 
    Could he have profited from appropriating Seneca dances?
    At the time the Charleston was surging in popularity, Arthur Murray (1895–1991) was busy expanding his franchise of dance studios aimed at common people until his name had become synonymous with dance in the United States.
    He grew up in New York City, child of Jewish immigrants from Austria, and started his first dance studios in North Carolina
    <aac:citation key="ArthurMurrayObit" />.
    Arthur Murray certainly had nothing to do with creating the Charleston, but he did much to popularize it.
    As he lived many years in the Hudson River Valley, he certainly may have passed through the Allegany Territory at some point, but it seems unlikely that he ever observed enough Seneca dancing to be able to draw on it in any significant way.
    </p>
    <p>
    On the other hand, it is not at all far-fetched that an American pop culture trend should be inspired by Native culture, since so many have been.
    Indeed, the vogue of <q>playing Indian</q> in white communities was at its height in the 1920s
    <aac:citation key="Deloria:PlayingIndian" />. <!-- TODO details -->
    The fashion trends embraced by <q>flappers</q> centered on unstructured, tunic-like dresses with long fringe, and headgear that often featured headbands.
    Feathered headdresses could still be seen as a holdover of Edwardian fashions from the preceding decades, some of which featured close-fitting hats with one or a few upright feathers
    <aac:citation key="EdwardianHats" />.
    These trends seem clearly inspired by Native American clothing as it was known then, and a Seneca observer could easily see the round-cap-with-feathers fashion as resembling a Haudenosaunee <em class="seneca">gasto:weh</em>
    (<aac:ref type="image" href="#img:Broadway-Rose" />
    <aac:ref type="image" href="#img:Crouse-UR">, </aac:ref>).

    <p>
    Some aspects of the Charleston also do parallel those of the Old Moccasin Dance:
    both are lively dances with repeated pulses on a single foot while the other foot is free to move, and both feature partners facing each other.
    You can, in fact, do the moves of Old Moccasin Dance to the music of the Charleston, and vice versa.
    (See the section on <a class="internal" href="#sec:moccasin-movements">the movements</a> below.)
    For a Seneca traditional singer in the era of the Charleston’s rise, it would stand out as the American popular dance most like the Old Moccasin Dance.
    </p>

    <p>
    Even if this particular example was not appropriated from indigenous
    culture, then, so many other things before and since have been that it seems
    reasonable to look at another hot new trend in mainstream US culture and
    say, <q>hey, we made that!</q>
    Arthur Murray represented dance as a popular commercial enterprise and would therefore be an obvious target in a story about profiting from appropriation.
    Of course, even in Bill’s story, the Charleston connection is presented as something of a guess, as is the link between the Charleston and <em class="seneca">Gayó:waga:yöh</em> specifically.
    </p>
    <p>
    Making this connection could express a desire to acknowledge the indigenous roots of American popular culture, to see a Seneca contribution in the mainstream spotlight.
    The teller also assumes that there is a pattern in which white men visit the Seneca community, take things that they learned with them, and then profit from those things in the outside world without acknowledging the source.
    That pattern was well established by scholars going back through Fenton all the way to Morgan.
    The story also provides a reading of the Charleston in Seneca terms, highlighting the similarity of some aspects of the dance.

    Speaking of Lewis Henry Morgan, that nineteenth-century ethnographer singled out moccasins as the greatest type of footwear ever invented, one of few aspects of Native culture that he believed were superior to European civilization 
    <aac:citation key="Morgan:League" pages="359–360" />:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      The moccason [...] is preëminently an Indian invention, and one of the highest antiquity.
      It is true to nature in its adjustment to the foot, beautiful in its materials and finish, and durable as an article of apparel.
      It will compare favorably with the best single article for the protection and adornment of the foot ever invented, either in ancient or modern times.
      With the sanction of fashion, it would supersed among us a long list of similar inventions.
      Other nations have falled behind the Indian, in this one particular at least.
      The masses of the Romans wore the calceus ligneus, or wooden shoe; the masses of Germany and Ireland, and of many of the European nations, formerly wore the same.
      With the cothurnus and sandal of the ancients, and the boot of the moderns, the moccason admits of no unfavorable comparison. 
      It deserves to be classed among the highest articles of apparel ever invented, both in usefulness, durability, and beauty.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
    The Minnetonka Moccasin company, whose <a href="https://www.zippia.com/minnetonka-moccasin-careers-398634/revenue/">annual revenue</a> in 2022 was <aac:usd />37.5 million, would seem to agree with Morgan that there is still plenty of value in the modern world for old moccasins.

    <h1>Songs</h1>
    <section id="sec:moccasin-words">
      <h2>Words</h2>
      <p>
      As with most other Seneca Earth Songs, the words of Old Moccasin Dance are meaningless vocables.
      A given song is always sung to the same words, such as <em>We:hanayögeh</em> for the traditional first song, but these words do not signify anything.
      The lyrical text in Andrew’s transcriptions are phonetic, according to Wallace Chafe’s orthography
      <aac:citation key="Chafe:Grammar" />.
      The division between <q>words</q> is somewhat arbitrary.
      The spelling reflects the relative length of the vowels as sung, so the same vocables may be spelled differently.
      The traditional second song is a good example of both problems, as the words repeat the sounds <em>weno</em> and <em>yane</em>, but each time with a different length and emphasis in the song: one of several possible transcriptions is <em>Wenoyane: weno:yane: wenoh ya:ne:</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
      The vocables help singers remember the songs, and may actually convey (or even encode) aspects of their sound and structure, though much more research is needed.
      The vocables certainly convey the rhythms of the songs, as repeated words are almost always sung to repeated rhythmic patterns:
      for example, though the four phrases in songs 5 and 6 have different melodic patterns, they all feature the same rhythm on the words <em>yo:-ha-wi-ya:h wënö’oyeh he:ya:</em>.
      That example also shows how repeating groups of words match up with the songs’ phrase structures.
      </p>
      <p>
      There is Seneca language in the closing song (in both recordings by the Allegany Singers): the single word <em class="seneca">gayó:wah</em>, moccasin.
      Other songs include vocable words like <em>gayoweh</em> that sound similar, but this may just be coincidence since variants of <em>gayowaneh</em> are among the most common vocables in Seneca songs.
      </p>
      <p>
      There are three pairs of songs in this version in which different vocables are sung to the same tune (3 and 4, 5 and 6, 14 and 15), and it is worth asking how the different vocables could match up with the same music.
      In songs 14 and 15, the difference is just between <em>gayowe:</em> and <em>gayowa:</em>, trading one vowel for another to switch from a vocable to the word for moccasin.
      In songs 3 and 4, <em>we:nuye:</em> and <em>ga:yowe:</em> are sung to the same long-short-long pattern, and in both cases the long, rounded vowels are open and unrounded and the short vowels in the middle are closed and rounded
      (<aac:ref type="table" href="#tab:moccasin-vowels" />).
      That is to say, the <em>relationship</em> 
      between <span class="ipa">/&#603;/</span> and <span class="ipa">/&#117;/</span> 
      is analogous to that 
      between <span class="ipa">/&#593;/</span> and <span class="ipa">/&#111;/</span>.

      The word <em>yö:hawiya:h</em> in song 5 is sung to the same basic pattern as <em>wë:noye:</em> in song 6, but the middle two notes of this pattern are slurred in song 6 and sung to the one syllable <em>no</em> (instead of <em>hawi</em>).
      TODO is it wë:nowiye: ?

    </section>
    <section id="sec:moccasin-music">
      <h2>Musical Structure</h2>
      <p>
      The basic structure of the song features an introduction by the lead, a refrain sung by all two or more times, and a concluding <em>yo:ho:h!</em>.
      The lead singer introduces each song by singing the first phrase.
      Beyond that, though, these songs do not feature call-and-response; the singers continue in unison.
      The singers repeat each song at least once and there are no other internal repeats.
      Most of the songs have three or four phrases; the phrases contrast but also echo each other, with small motives repeated or varied in subsquent phrases.
      The following analysis is based on the 2002 recording by the Allegany Singers with Kyle Dowdy singing lead
      (<aac:ref type="video" href="#vid:moccasin-score" />).
      </p>

      <p>
      As is the case with other Earth Songs, the Moccasin Dance songs are quite distinct from each other but still suggest a strong family resemblance.
      They sound like they belong to the same dance even though there are different types of melodies and rhythms.
      </p>
      <p>
      One reason they sound similar is that they use the same set of pitches.
      These songs are consistently diatonic, with most songs using six notes of the major scale (i.e., a major hexachord) and a few adding a <aac:degree accid="fl" n="7" />
      (<aac:ref type="table" href="#tab:moccasin-pitches" />).
      </p>
      <xi:include href="table-moccasin-pitches.xhtml" />
      <p>
      Each song is built from a limited set of patterns in words, pitches, and rhythms.
      The refrain of the first song, for example, consists of just the vocable <em>we:hanayöge:h</em> repeated four times
      (<aac:ref type="music" href="#mus:moccasin-song1" />).
      Each of those times makes up one of the four phrases in the refrain.
      All four phrases have the same basic rhythm matching with the word:
      <aac:inlineMusic type="rhythm-lyrics" src="media/moccasin-song1-rhythm.svg" />.
      In each phrase, the melody goes up on the syllable <em>yö</em>.
      The emphasized notes in the first two phrases outline ascending thirds (G–B, B–D), and those in the remaining phrases emphasize single notes (B, A) following a descending outline back to G.
      </p>
      <figure class="music" id="mus:moccasin-song1">
        <img src="media/moccasin-song1.svg" type="image/svg+xml" />
        <figCaption><em class="seneca">Gayó:waga:yöh</em>, first song as sung by the Allegany Singers, Kyle Dowdy, lead (2002)</figCaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
      The second song is more complex and shows how much variety can be created from a constrained set of materials
      (<aac:ref type="music" href="#mus:moccasin-song2" />).
      The words repeat <em>wenoyane</em> with different accents and lengths.
      The basic rhythmic motive is <aac:inlineMusic type="rhythm-lyrics" src="media/moccasin-song2-rhythm.svg" />, which recurs at the beginning of the first phrase and the end of the other three.
      This motive is syncopated against the underlying duple pulse played by rattle and drum, and in relation to the strong emphasis on the long notes of <aac:inlineMusic type="rhythm-lyrics" src="media/moccasin-song2-rhythm2.svg" />.
      The melody goes down every time on <em>weno</em>.
      In pitches the first phrase emphasizes B (<em>mi</em> in solfège), the second A (<em>re</em>), and the last two phrases, which are identical, emphasize G (<em>do</em>).
      The first, third, and fourth phrases all emphasize the melodic interval of a descending third.
      </p>
      <figure class="music" id="mus:moccasin-song2">
        <img src="media/moccasin-song2.svg" type="image/svg+xml" />

      </figure>
      <p>
      Not only does each song use limited means, but the whole set of songs features a small set of recurring patterns.
      We can identify two core rhythmic patterns introduced in the first two songs: first a dotted, duple eighth-note pattern in song 1,
      and second a syncopated quarter-eighth-quarter rhythm in song 2
      (<aac:ref type="table" href="#tab:moccasin-rhythm_patterns" />).
      If we are somewhat flexible in matching these patterns (accepting subdivisions and minor variations), then we can group all the songs from this recording into one of these two patterns, except for one.
      There are also characteristic patterns at the ends of phrases, which mostly line up with the patterns just mentioned.
      </p>
      <xi:include href="table-moccasin-rhythm_patterns.xhtml" />

      <xi:include href="table-moccasin-rhythm_pattern_3.xhtml" />
      <p>
      Song 10 has its own pattern, a fast syncopated rhythm like a Caribbean <em>tresillo</em> with 3+3+2 groups of sixteenth notes, that is distinct from all the other songs.
      Its long-short-short ending pattern is also unique.
      Bill says that Kyle Dowdy learned this song from singers of Six Nations, Ontario, and thinks it does not fit as well with the other songs.
      The Allegany Singers did not include this one in their more recent recording.
      Fans of music theory puzzles might imagine that this song’s tresillo pattern in sixteenth notes is a diminution of the eighth-note tresillo pattern in song 2.
      But it seems more plausible that song 10’s core rhythm is a highly elaborated version of the Syncopated pattern
      (<aac:ref type="music" href="#mus:moccasin-song10" />).

      Most of the songs have three or four phrases; the phrases contrast but also echo each other, with small motives repeated or varied in subsquent phrases.
      There are several patterns of these phrases: the most common is that each phrase is different from the previous one (A B C or A B C D); in several other songs one of the phrases returns, often in a varied form (such as A B C C, A B B, A B C B, A A B B).

    <!-- TODO music example of one song: label or discuss in text (1) lead intro, (2) first choral verse, (3) second choral verse  -->
    <p>
    Old Moccasin Dance starts with a circle of only men dancing counterclockwise as usual.
    Women line up and step into the circle in between the men, in the pattern female-male-male-female (so the first woman steps in front of the first man and the second woman steps behind the second man).
    In the middle of each song, the two members of each pair will switch places.
    Thus the head of the line at the start will be two couples arranged FM–MF; when they rotate it will become MF–FM; when they rotate again in the next song they will be back to FM–MF.
    </p>
    <p>
    Each song starts with an introduction by the lead singer, in relatively
    free rhythm, with the rattle shaking continuously; during the intro the
    dancers just walk forward at a free pace.
    Next the rest of the singers join in to sing the melody and the rattle and drum begin to play a regular beat, typically emphasizing the smaller rhythmic subdivision (eighth notes in the transcription;
    <aac:ref type="table" href="#tab:moccasin-steps" />).
    During this section, which we will call the first choral verse, the dancers begin to dance with a slow step, right–right, left–left, one step per beat (quarter note).
    When the singers repeat the melody, the rattle and drum shift to a <q>half-time</q> feel, emphasizing the main beat (quarter notes); we call this the second choral verse.
    </p>
    <xi:include href="table-moccasin-steps.xhtml" />
    <p>
    Now the second dancer in each pair moves ahead of their partner and turns around to face them.
    Men moving forward should go on the outside of the circle while women should go on the inside.
    The dancers shift to a faster step that includes a step and shuffle on the right foot, a quick change to the other and back, and ends with a longer step on the left
    (<aac:ref type="table" href="#tab:moccasin-steps" />).

    The rear-facing dancer does this step in reverse.
    When the song ends with <em>yo:ho:h</em>, the front dancer turns again to face forward and the dance repeats for the next song.

    The traditional last song features a special rhythm and a step to match: the dancers stop and hold their step for a quarter note
    on the words <em>yo:h ga:yowa:h</em>, while the rattle and drum also stop.

    The pattern of when to dance, when to rotate positions, and the basic steps are all prescribed, but within that this type of dance allows people freedom to move in their own ways.
    There is freedom and opportunity for creativity in moving the upper body and arms, and dancers can also do more complex variations on the basic step.

    Other than the traditional gender pairings, there are no restrictions on who can dance with whom in Old Moccasin Dance, and no one assigns any meaning to the pairings.
    The exact pairings of men and women results somewhat randomly from the way women line up and insert themselves into the circle of dancers, though Bill says some women have been known to time their entry just right to end up with someone in particular.
    Even then, however, this is not any kind of lovers’ dance, but an energetic, even athletic, dance of the whole community.
