    Robin Dance can be sung any time, but is most closely associated with the start of spring.
    The song honors the robin as a harbinger of spring after the long winter: as Bill says, <q>We’re honoring the robin, so we welcome it back</q>
    (<aac:ref  type="audio" href="#aud:robin-crouse-intro" />).
    The Robin Dance songs seem to imitate the song of the <em class="seneca">jö:yaik</em> (American robin), while the side-to-side dance suggests the bird’s hopping movements.

    <h1>Story</h1>
    <p>
    According to Seneca oral tradition, the Robin Dance was a gift to the people from the robin, and the robin was originally a human boy.
    That boy went out into the woods with his uncle on a vision quest, and while he was fasting and waiting for a vision, he grew ill and began to waste away.
    His uncle found him on the point of death, with his chest painted red, but the boy begged to wait another day.
    When the uncle returned the last time, he found a bird who told him,
    <q>I am your nephew. I am <em class="seneca">jö:yaik</em>,</q> the robin, and from now on he would be the sign that spring was returning.
    He gave the people his songs as a way of honoring him and the promise of spring.

    The Seneca Robin Dance is evidence of a long, close relationship between humans and robins in this region, which Western science confirms.
    The American robin (<em class="latin">Turdus migratorius</em>) lives all across North America and probably has always lived close by humans as it does today, and it is known as <q>an accomplished and pleasing singer</q>
    <aac:citation key="GaleScience:Robins" />.
    Robins have existed in their modern form for more than 300,000 years, before humans arrived, but they have always thrived in areas settled by people because they prefer to hunt in grassy, open areas
    <aac:citation key="Gelbart:PleistoceneRobins" />.
    <!-- TODO bad source, look at Topp et al. article or other -->
    <q>Because the species is so widespread, virtually all North Americans hear, and are warmed by, the lovely melody of the robin during the spring and summer, although many people do not recognize its song as such.
    Those who do, however, widely regard the early migrating American robin to be  a longed-for harbinger of springtime and warmer weather, because this bird often arrives at the northern parts of its range and sings while there is still snow on the ground</q>
    <aac:citation key="GaleScience:Robins" />.
