    <em class="seneca">Gayó:waga:yöh</em> or Old Moccasin Dance is an energetic dance for pairs of men and women moving together around the circle.
    This dance is of the same type as Fish Dance and Sharpen Stick Dance, in that it features pairs of men and women who dance facing each other.
    In the middle of each song, the members of each pair switch places with each other.
    Old Moccasin Dance can be sung on any normal social-dance occasion and at any point in the set.
    This dance can also be used as a medicine ceremony as part of the Midwinter Ceremonies.

    Bill speaks of Earth Songs like <a href="robin.html">Robin Dance</a> or <a href="corn.html">Corn Dance</a> as a means for people to honor and give thanks to elements of Creation, in just the same way that Haudenosaunee people extend gratitude to these elements in the daily <em class="seneca">Ganö:nyök</em> or Thanksgiving Address.
    Old Moccasin Dance, like <a href="quiver.html">Standing Quiver</a>, focuses directly on the dancing of the human community, and this fits with the first traditional element of the Thanksgiving Address:
    <em>ha’deyögwe’da:ge:h</em>, all the different kinds of people. 
    Human-centered Earth Songs provide a way to celebrate human beings and their relationships with each other, including male–female relationships.

    <h1>Story</h1>
    <p>
    Bill’s great-grandfather Richard Johnny-John used to tell a story about Moccasin Dance when he presented the dance in shows, and other presenters still repeat this story.
    One time in the old days they were having a social at the old Coldspring Longhouse, and since it was open to the public and not far from the highway sometimes outsiders would sit in.
    On this occasion there was a white man that no one else knew, there with his family.
    He listened and took lots of notes in his notebook.
    Years later Bill’s great-grandfather saw this white man in the news and realized he was Arthur Murray.
    He was doing the Charleston, which he said he invented.
    Bill’s grandfather realized he had based it on the Seneca Moccasin Dance.
    </p>
    <p>
    Is there any chance that the Seneca Old Moccasin Dance influenced the Charleston?
    Oral accounts and documentary evidence from when the Charleston dance first emerged in the 1920s all point to an origin among African-American communities of the early twentieth century
    <aac:citation key="Conyers:Charleston" />.
    The Charleston became famous after it first appeared on the Broadway stage in the 1923 musical <cite>Runnin’ Wild</cite> with words and music by prominent Black composers Cecil Mack and James P. Johnson
    <aac:citation key="MackJohnson:Charleston" />.
    While the song and dance probably descend from earlier Black dances (of the <q>Buck</q> and <q>Wing</q> varieties), Mack and Johnson’s song emphasizes the song’s newness: it is <q>a new tune,/ Funny blue tune</q>, <q>Made in South Caroline</q>.
    Johnson said he was inspired by the dance routines and ring-shout calls of Gullah Geechee dockworkers, and other accounts of the time suggest these dances were popularized by tours of the Charleston’s Jenkins Orphanage Band
    <aac:citation key="CharlestonRoots" />.
    </p>

    </figure>
    <p>
    What about Arthur Murray, then? 
    Could he have profited from appropriating Seneca dances?
    At the time the Charleston was surging in popularity, Arthur Murray (1895–1991) was busy expanding his franchise of dance studios aimed at common people until his name had become synonymous with dance in the United States.
    He grew up in New York City, the child of Jewish immigrants from Austria, and started his first dance studios in North Carolina
    <aac:citation key="ArthurMurrayObit" />.
    Arthur Murray certainly had nothing to do with creating the Charleston, but he did much to popularize it.
    As he lived many years in the Hudson River Valley, he may have passed through the Allegany Territory at some point, but it seems unlikely that he ever observed enough Seneca dancing to be able to draw on it in any significant way.
    </p>
    <p>
    On the other hand, it is not at all far-fetched that an American pop culture trend should be inspired by Native culture, since so many have been.
    Indeed, the vogue of <q>playing Indian</q> in white communities was at its height in the 1920s
    <aac:citation key="Deloria:PlayingIndian" />.
    The fashion trends embraced by <q>flappers</q> centered on unstructured, tunic-like dresses with long fringe, and headgear that often featured headbands.
    Feathered headdresses could still be seen as a holdover of Edwardian fashions from the preceding decades, some of which featured close-fitting hats with one or a few upright feathers
    <aac:citation key="EdwardianHats" />.
    These trends seem clearly inspired by Native American clothing as it was known then, and a Seneca observer could easily see the round-cap-with-feathers fashion as resembling a Haudenosaunee <em class="seneca">gasto:weh</em>
    (<aac:ref type="image" href="#img:Broadway-Rose" />

    <p>
    Some aspects of the Charleston also do parallel those of the Old Moccasin Dance:
    both are lively dances with repeated pulses on a single foot while the other foot is free to move, and both feature partners facing each other.
    You can, in fact, do the moves of Old Moccasin Dance to the music of the Charleston, and vice versa.
    (See the section on <a class="internal" href="#sec:moccasin-movements">the movements</a> below.)
    For a Seneca traditional singer of the Jazz Age, the Charleston would stand out as the American popular dance most like the Old Moccasin Dance.
    </p>

    </figure>
    <p>
    Even if this particular example was not appropriated from indigenous
    culture, then, so many other things before and since have been that it seems
    reasonable to look at another hot new trend in mainstream US culture and
    say, <q>hey, we made that!</q>
    Arthur Murray represented dance as a popular commercial enterprise and would therefore be an obvious target in a story about profiting from appropriation.
    Of course, even in Bill’s story, the Charleston connection is presented as something of a guess, as is the link between the Charleston and <em class="seneca">Gayó:waga:yöh</em> specifically.
    </p>
    <p>
    Making this connection could express a desire to acknowledge the indigenous roots of American popular culture, to see a Seneca contribution in the mainstream spotlight.
    The story insists that Seneca dances are as modern as any and that Seneca people are not stuck in the past.
    As Haudenosaunee singer Sadie Buck declares, <q>Today I’m modern; tomorrow I’ll be modern ’til tomorrow; yesterday I was modern for yesterday</q>
    <aac:citation key="Avery:NativeClassical" pages="198" />.
    </p>
    <p>
    The story also reminds Seneca hearers that their culture is a treasure that outsiders will want to exploit.
    The teller highlights the pattern, well established by scholars from Morgan to Fenton, in which white men visit the Seneca community, take things that they learned with them, and then profit from those things in the outside world without acknowledging the source
    <aac:citation key="McCarthy:Iroquoianist" />.
    Outside observers in the community are likely steal and misrepresent what they see.
    Andrew hopes that his involvement in this project as a settler musicologist breaks that pattern of exploitation and instead helps to strengthen Native sovereignty and promote greater respect and deeper understanding in the non-Native world.
    </p>
    <p>
    Speaking of Lewis Henry Morgan, that nineteenth-century ethnographer singled out <q>the moccason</q> as the greatest type of footwear ever invented, one of few aspects of Native culture that he believed were superior to European civilization 
    <aac:citation key="Morgan:League" pages="359–360" />:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      The moccason [...] is preëminently an Indian invention, and one of the highest antiquity.
      It is true to nature in its adjustment to the foot, beautiful in its materials and finish, and durable as an article of apparel.
      It will compare favorably with the best single article for the protection and adornment of the foot ever invented, either in ancient or modern times.
      With the sanction of fashion, it would supersed among us a long list of similar inventions.
      Other nations have falled behind the Indian, in this one particular at least.
      The masses of the Romans wore the calceus ligneus, or wooden shoe; the masses of Germany and Ireland, and of many of the European nations, formerly wore the same.
      With the cothurnus and sandal of the ancients, and the boot of the moderns, the moccason admits of no unfavorable comparison. 
      It deserves to be classed among the highest articles of apparel ever invented, both in usefulness, durability, and beauty.
    </blockquote>

    The Minnetonka Moccasin company, whose <a href="https://www.zippia.com/minnetonka-moccasin-careers-398634/revenue/">annual revenue</a> in 2022 was <aac:usd />37.5 million, would seem to agree with Morgan that the old moccasin still holds plenty of value in the modern world.

    <h1>Songs</h1>
    <section id="sec:moccasin-words">
      <h2>Words</h2>
      <p>
      As with most other Seneca Earth Songs, the words of Old Moccasin Dance are vocables without linguistic meaning.
      A given song is always sung to the same words, such as <em>We:hanayögeh</em> for the traditional first song, but these words do not signify anything.
      The lyrical text in Andrew’s transcriptions are phonetic, according to Wallace Chafe’s orthography
      <aac:citation key="Chafe:Grammar" />.
      The division between <q>words</q> is somewhat arbitrary: 
      the spelling reflects the relative length of the vowels as sung, so the same vocables may be spelled differently.
      The traditional second song is a good example of both problems, as the words repeat the sounds <em>weno</em> and <em>yane</em>, but each time with a different length and emphasis in the song: one of several possible transcriptions is <em>Wenoyane: weno:yane: wenoh ya:ne:</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
      There is Seneca language in the closing song (in both recordings by the Allegany Singers): the single word <em class="seneca">gayó:wah</em>, moccasin.
      Other songs include vocable words like <em>gayoweh</em> that sound similar, but this may just be coincidence since variants of <em>gayowaneh</em> are among the most common vocables in Seneca songs.
      The vocables help singers remember the songs by preserving (one might even say encoding) aspects of their sound and structure, though much more research is needed in this area.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="sec:moccasin-music">
      <h2>Musical Structure</h2>
      <p>
      The basic structure of the song features an introduction by the lead, a refrain sung by all two or more times, and a concluding <em>yo:ho:h!</em>.
      The lead singer introduces each song by singing the first phrase.
      Beyond that, though, these songs do not feature call-and-response; the singers continue in unison.
      The singers repeat each song at least once and there are no other internal repeats.
      Most of the songs have three or four phrases; the phrases contrast but also echo each other, with small motives repeated or varied in subsequent phrases.
      The rhythmic patterns in song 1 and song 2 recur throughout the other songs.
      See the <a class="internal" href="moccasin-analysis.html">analysis</a> for a more detailed look at the patterns that tie together these songs.

      <h2>Versions</h2>
      <p>
      Bill’s teacher Avery Jimerson taught him always to begin <em class="seneca">Gayó:waga:yöh</em> with the same two songs, as heard on both Allegany Singers recordings.
      After that, Kyle Dowdy’s choices as lead in the earlier recording featured more songs that he had learned from singers on other territories, particularly Six Nations in Ontario.
      The song selection in the more recent recording (with Jacob Dowdy singing lead) are more traditional to <em class="seneca">Ohi:yo’</em>, according to Bill.
      </p>
      <p>
      One of the oldest known recordings of Haudenosaunee songs includes at least one song from Old Moccasin Dance as known today.
      In 1911 a Huron (Wyandot) man named Smith Nichols sang several songs for Canadian ethnologist Marius Barbeau.
      The wax-cylinder recordings are preserved today at the Canadian Museum of History, and one is recognizable as a <em>Gayó:waga:yöh</em> song still in living oral tradition
      (<aac:ref type="audio" href="#aud:moccasin-Nichols" />).

      <p>
      Song 119 has a <q>burden</q> (refrain) transcribed <q>wenuya ne he nuyane</q>, and the recording is nearly identical to song 2 in both recordings by the Allegany Singers
      (<aac:ref type="music" href="#mus:moccasin-Nichols" />).
      The earlier singer’s words differ by only one syllable: his sixth syllable is <em>hë</em> rather than <em>wë</em>.
      The rhythms are identical except that Nichols sings a long note instead of a sixteenth-note run on the second <em>yane:</em>.
      His pitches are different in the second phrase, but follow the same contour.

      The transcriber described this song (numbered 119) as a <q>dance around the fire</q> for men and women.
      The previous entry (song 118) in the notes corresponds to a recording of an unknown melody, but it bears this description:</p>
      <blockquote>
        Kăyúwa (no meaning) is the name of that song:<br />
        hiyeyuwahine, wenuyiehine hiyuweyuwahine ... (burden) ... <br />
        Men’s + women dance, around the fire. It is probably the property of the Wyandot originally.
      </blockquote>
      <p class="continue">
      <em>Gayó:wah</em> is Seneca for moccasin, of course; the song after this is an Old Moccasin Dance song today; and the vocables for other songs in this series closely resemble Moccasin Dance songs.
      Further research would be needed to evaluate the claim that this song was originally Wyandot (Huron) and not Seneca.

    <h1>Movements</h1>
    <!-- TODO music example of one song: label or discuss in text (1) lead intro, (2) first choral verse, (3) second choral verse  -->
    <p>
    Old Moccasin Dance starts with a circle of only men dancing counterclockwise as usual.
    Women line up and step into the circle in between the men, in the pattern female-male-male-female (so the first woman steps in front of the first man and the second woman steps behind the second man).
    In the middle of each song, the two members of each pair will switch places.
    Thus the head of the line at the start will be two couples arranged FM–MF; when they rotate it will become MF–FM; when they rotate again in the next song they will be back to FM–MF.
    </p>
    <figure class="image" id="img:moccasin-plain">

    </figure>
    <p>
    Each song starts with an introduction by the lead singer, in relatively
    free rhythm, with the rattle shaking continuously; during the intro the
    dancers just walk forward at a free pace.
    Next the rest of the singers join in to sing the melody and the rattle and drum begin to play a regular beat, typically emphasizing the smaller rhythmic subdivision (eighth notes in the transcription;
    <aac:ref type="table" href="#tab:moccasin-steps" />).
    During this section, which we will call the first refrain, the dancers begin to dance with a slow step, right–right, left–left, one step per beat (quarter note).
    When the singers repeat the melody, the rattle and drum shift to a <q>half-time</q> feel, emphasizing the main beat (quarter notes); this is the second refrain.
    </p>
    <xi:include href="../tables/moccasin-steps.xhtml" />
    <p>
    Now the second dancer in each pair moves ahead of their partner and turns around to face them.
    Men moving forward should go on the outside of the circle while women should go on the inside.
    The dancers shift to a faster step that includes a step and shuffle on the right foot, a quick change to the other and back, and ends with a longer step on the left
    (<aac:ref type="table" href="#tab:moccasin-steps" />).
    The rear-facing dancer does this step in reverse.
    When the song ends with <em>yo:ho:h</em>, the front dancer turns again to face forward and the dance repeats for the next song.
    </p>
    <p>
    The traditional last song features a special rhythm and a step to match: the dancers stop and hold their step for a quarter note
    on the words <em>yo:h ga:yowa:h</em>, while the rattle and drum also stop.
    </p>
    <p>
    The pattern of when to dance, when to rotate positions, and the basic steps are all prescribed, but within that this type of dance allows people freedom to move in their own ways.
    There is freedom and opportunity for creativity in moving the upper body and arms, and dancers can also do more complex variations on the basic step.
    </p>
    <p>
    Other than the traditional gender pairings, there are no restrictions on who can dance with whom in Old Moccasin Dance, and no one assigns any meaning to the pairings.
    The exact pairings of men and women results somewhat randomly from the way women line up and insert themselves into the circle of dancers, though Bill says some women have been known to time their entry just right to end up with someone in particular.
    Even then, however, this is not any kind of lovers’ dance, but an energetic, even athletic, dance of the whole community.
