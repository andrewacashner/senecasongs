    <h2>Personal Statement (Andrew)</h2>
    <p>
    I proposed this project to Bill because I wanted to use the privilege and resources I had as a university researcher to benefit the Seneca Nation.
    </p>
    <p>
    I want you to know where I am coming from and why this project has been important to me.
    I live with my family in Rochester, New York, just west of the Genesee River.
    I am a settler on Seneca land.
    I grew up in Richmond, Indiana, a small city east of Indianapolis.
    My parents are both retired public-school teachers.
    My ancestors on both sides were German and English settlers of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Virginia, and Kentucky.
    </p>
    <p>
    As a musician, I play piano and organ and have led church choirs and worship bands in numerous churches.
    My training is Classical but I enjoy playing jazz, gospel, pop, and R<aac:ampersand />B and free improvisation; I also compose and arrange.
    As a musicologist I have researched and written about music in the early modern world, with focus on religious music of Mexico and Spain in the seventeenth century, and an additional interest in music in the history of science and computing.
    I am also an avid computer programmer.
    </p>
    <p>
    I became interested in this project when I was looking for new research topics after finishing my first book in 2019.
    As I was studying music in colonial Mexico I had become increasingly interested in the intercultural exchanges and power relationships between the Spanish colonizers, indigenous peoples of the Americas, and enslaved people from Africa.
    I wanted to look at similar issues closer to home both for practical reasons and because I wanted to feel more grounded in my adopted home of western New York after many years moving, from Indiana to Chicago to Los Angeles.
    I initially intended to do a comparative study of sacred song among different communities of colonial-era New York, one of which would be the Haudenosaunee. Since there have been too many early modern projects that talk about indigenous peoples only through the lens of European documents, I wanted to learn from living practitioners of the oral tradition.
    </p>
    <p>
    I quickly discovered that there was so much to learn about the Native side, and there were so many unique challenges of that topic, that it was worth just learning about the oral traditions of the nation indigenous to where I live.
    Perhaps someday I will be able to apply what I’ve learned to that larger project.
    Even though my original interest was in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, I realized that the only access to the historic music was through the living oral traditions, and the only way to learn those was with the willing collaboration of a Native knowledge keeper.
    </p>
    <p>
    I met Bill Crouse after I inquired at Ganondagan Seneca Art and Culture Center about hiring a musician to teach in my class at the University of Rochester.
    I began inviting Bill to visit my class annually and slowly got to know him and build up my knowledge of Seneca social dance songs.
    I was reading scholarship like William Fenton’s studies that were largely focused on Seneca ceremony and other restricted knowledge.
    So there had been all this attention on things Seneca people did not want to share, while the social-dance songs had been hardly studied, though Seneca people are not only willing to share these and in fact have used them for cross-cultural hospitality since before Europeans arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
    As I got to know Bill and other Seneca people, I began to discover how much ill will many Senecas had against anthropologists and other academics who claimed to be experts on their culture.
    In the midst of the political upheavals of 2020, I became increasingly concerned about my own ignorance of non-Eurocentric music traditions and my complicity in musicology and academia’s history of promoting white cultural supremacy.
    As I learned about the history of the land I lived on—land promised to the Senecas in the still-valid 1794 Treaty of Canandaigua—and learned about the Haudenosaunee concept of the Covenant Chain, I began to look for active ways to contribute to the goals of Land Back and Seneca sovereignty.
    I wanted active decolonization, not just metaphorically <q>decolonizing the syllabus</q> or the conference program by including some new items while retaining the Eurocentric philosophy and structure and its culturally white values.
    I began looking for an active way to use my skills and my position to support Seneca sovereignty.
    </p>
    <p>
    So I proposed to Bill that we do this project together as coauthors, and we had several discussions about what each of us wanted to get out of it and how we could design the project to be of mutual benefit to us and our communities, though where our interests ever diverged, we would favor Bill’s and what would be most helpful to his community.
    I needed another publication project to strengthen my tenure case (I thought); I wanted to provide resource for other college, secondary, and even elementary educators that would provide reliable info from an authoritative Seneca perspective, because that was so hard to find.
    I also wanted my university to use its resources, derived ultimately from Seneca land, and its space on that land, for the practical economic benefit of Seneca people.
    Bill had his own goals that overlapped with mine but were also quite distinct, as he explains elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
    Personally I also wanted to feel more grounded in my adopted home, more connected to its history, facing up to the real legacies of my ancestors and being part of the solution, even if only a tiny part.
    I wanted to help repair and polish the Covenant Chain of friendship that already bound my community to our Native hosts and help build a better world for my children.
    I hoped to set the record straight on the Native contribution to American music history so my students, colleagues, and children could gain a better understanding of the world than I was given in my own upbringing and education.
    </p>
    <p>
    I designed the project around my own interests in technology and digital publishing because I wanted to develop better ways to communicate about music using multimedia in an online environment.
    I didn’t anticipate doing all the photos and video myself but I have enjoyed that part (while recognizing that pros could do it all much better).
    My own background included studies in ethnomusicology theory and methods but I still would not identify as an ethnomusicologist.
    I had neither the skills nor the desire to do a fully ethnographic, anthropological project.
    So I liked the interview-based methodology of working with a single practitioner as an equal coauthor, and focused my own work on learning, transcribing, and analyzing the music.
    </p>
    <p>
    The project has been profoundly meaningful to me.
    Coming to understand the traditional Seneca way of life has helped me understand my own connection to the place I live.
    I’ll never see a robin again without thinking of Robin Dance and all I learned in researching and reflecting on that.
    <em class="seneca">Gano:nyök</em> has given me an orientation for understanding my place in the world and rooted me in an ethic of gratitude.
    I am a white man, through and through, and I will never be Seneca, I know that.
    My own worldview is still largely shaped by Christianity.
    But there is no psalm in the Bible that talks about maple trees, or robins, or the Three Sisters.
    I know hundreds of Christian hymns but none of them are rooted in that kind of specificity of place.
    I am deeply grateful to Ja:no’s Bowen for teaching me a beginning amount of Seneca and allowing me to be part of her class.
