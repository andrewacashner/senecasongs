    <h2>Personal Statement (Andrew)</h2>
    <p>
    It is still the norm in Western universities for researchers to keep themselves out of their writing in order to create a sense of universal objectivity, and to build up a fortification of citations and logical argumentation to forestall any criticism.
    This is very much in contrast to the traditional practice in indigenous communities, where speakers are expected to situate themselves within a place and a network of relationships past and present, but then are understood to be speaking only for themselves on the basis of their own experiences and their nation's worldview.
    Therefore, as uncomfortable as it feels to foreground myself for a moment, I do feel it is important to say where I am coming from, how I came to this project, and where I hope we go with this effort.

    I live with my wife and two children in the Nineteenth Ward of Rochester, New York, just west of the Genesee River.
    My house occupies territory that was guaranteed to the Seneca Nation in perpetuity by the 1794 Canandaigua Treaty bearing the signature of George Washington himself.

    I was born and raised in Richmond, Indiana, a small city east of Indianapolis on the border with Ohio.
    My parents are retired public-school teachers.
    My mom is from my hometwon and her family roots are with the Hostetters, Loars, and other Pennsylvania Dutch (that is, German) settlers of northeast Ohio and Pennsylvania.
    My dad is from southern California but his mother actually grew up on a farm in Indiana and both his parents have roots in Kentucky and Virginia.
    Their ancestors were a mix of settlers from the British Isles and Germany (Cashner probably used to be KÃ¼rschner---furrier---or something similar).

    I am a pianist, organist, singer, and composer.
    I studied music at Lawrence University in Wisconsin, where I met my wife; at New England Conservatory in Boston, the University of Notre Dame in Indiana, and the University of Chicago, where I earned my PhD in the history and theory of music.
