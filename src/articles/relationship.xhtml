    This project centers around three linked pairs of concepts: Earth/land, history/tradition, and relationship/reciprocity.
    Many Native American nations, and other indigenous peoples, have traditionally emphasized that all people, animals, and other beings and forces on Earth are interlinked in reciprocal relationships.
    This idea is fundamental to the Seneca practice of singing and dancing Earth Songs.

    Every traditional Haudenosaunee formal gathering begins and ends with an address known as <em class="seneca">Gano:nyök</em>, or the Thanksgiving Address.
    This speech is extemporized in the local language (such as Seneca on Seneca territory, or Mohawk on Mohawk territory) according to a set traditional pattern.
    On Seneca territory, the speaker (normally a male elder) would begin with
    an introduction inviting all present to join their minds as one with him in giving thanks.
    The first element is <em class="seneca">ha’deögwe’da:geh</em>, all the different kinds of people.
    Next the speaker thanks <q>Our Mother the Earth</q> and then moves through all the chief elements of the world and its beings: the waters, medicinal plants, grasses, berries, strawberries, the Three Sisters (corn, beans, and squash), forests, the maple trees, animals, birds, Our Elder Brother the Sun and Our Grandmother the Moon, the stars, the winds, and others, ending with <em class="seneca">Shögwajënö’kda’öh</em>, Our Creator.

    For traditional Seneca people, the Thanksgiving Address is one of the most central concepts and tools for thinking and making sense of the world.
    The Seneca-Iroquois National Museum in Salamanca is entirely organized according to <em class="seneca">Gano:nyök</em>, for example: 
    visitors move in the archtypical Haudenosaunee counterclockwise circle through the different parts of the address, with sections on history, arts, dance, and other parts of culture keyed to parts of the address.
    Seneca teacher John Mohawk used the address as the organizing structure for several of his works, rather the way Christian theologians used the Apostles’ Creed or the Lord’s Prayer to structure their works.
    In Ja:no’s Bowen’s Seneca language class for adult beginners, classes began and ended with some version of the address, which became a focal point for teaching about vocabulary, grammar, and cultural values.

    The Thanksgiving Address provides the particular Seneca way of centering life in a web of reciprocal relationships, as most other indigenous American nations do.
    Humans are understood to be lesser, weaker members of a larger extended family that includes non-human creatures, animals, and plants, and beyond-human beings like the spirits of sun, moon, and stars, within a worldview where, as John Mohawk says, everything that is real has spirit and can be related to as a being.
    </p>
    <p>
    The Seneca language used in the address aids in this way of thinking because the grammar requires constant attention to relationships.
