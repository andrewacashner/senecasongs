    This project centers around three linked pairs of concepts: Earth/land, history/tradition, and relationship/reciprocity.
    Many Native American nations, and other indigenous peoples, have traditionally emphasized that all people, animals, and other beings and forces on Earth are interlinked in reciprocal relationships.
    This idea is fundamental to the Seneca practice of singing and dancing Earth Songs.

    <h1><em class="seneca">Gano:nyök</em>: Rooting Relationships with All Created Beings in Gratitude</h1>
    <p>
    Every traditional Haudenosaunee formal gathering begins and ends with an address known as <em class="seneca">Gano:nyök</em>, or the Thanksgiving Address.
    This speech is extemporized in the local language (such as Seneca on Seneca territory, or Mohawk on Mohawk territory) according to a set traditional pattern.
    On Seneca territory, the speaker (normally a male elder) would begin with
    an introduction inviting all present to join their minds as one with him in giving thanks.
    The first element is <em class="seneca">ha’deögwe’da:geh</em>, all the different kinds of people.
    Next the speaker thanks <q>Our Mother the Earth</q> and then moves through all the chief elements of the world and its beings: the waters, medicinal plants, grasses, berries, strawberries, the Three Sisters (corn, beans, and squash), forests, the maple trees, animals, birds, Our Elder Brother the Sun and Our Grandmother the Moon, the stars, the winds, and others, ending with <em class="seneca">Shögwajënö’kda’öh</em>, Our Creator.
    </p>
    <p>
    For traditional Seneca people, the Thanksgiving Address is one of the most central concepts and tools for thinking and making sense of the world.
    The Seneca-Iroquois National Museum in Salamanca is entirely organized according to <em class="seneca">Gano:nyök</em>, for example: 
    visitors move in the archtypical Haudenosaunee counterclockwise circle through the different parts of the address, with sections on history, arts, dance, and other parts of culture keyed to parts of the address.
    Seneca teacher John Mohawk used the address as the organizing structure for several of his works, rather the way Christian theologians used the Apostles’ Creed or the Lord’s Prayer to structure their works.
    In Ja:no’s Bowen’s Seneca language class for adult beginners, classes began and ended with some version of the address, which became a focal point for teaching about vocabulary, grammar, and cultural values.
    </p>
    <p>
    The Thanksgiving Address provides the particular Seneca way of centering life in a web of reciprocal relationships, as most other indigenous American nations do.
    Humans are understood to be lesser, weaker members of a larger extended family that includes non-human creatures, animals, and plants, and beyond-human beings like the spirits of sun, moon, and stars, within a worldview where, as John Mohawk says, everything that is real has spirit and can be related to as a being.
    </p>
    <p>
    The Seneca language used in the address aids in this way of thinking because the grammar requires constant attention to relationships.
    The speaker addresses not <q>Earth</q> generally but <em class="seneca">Ëthino’ëh yöëdzade’</em>, where the <em>ethi-</em> prefix means a relation of all of us to her—<q><em>Our</em> Mother the Earth</q>.
    Likewise for the <em class="seneca">shogwa-</em> in <q>Our Creator</q>.
    There are fifteen nominative pronouns in Seneca and some thirty transitive pronouns that convey highly specific relationships.
    A simple salutation, <em class="seneca">ësgöge’ae’</em> (I will see you again), must be conjugated depending on the number and gender of the speaker and the people addressed.
    To say goodbye to two people (but not more) of mixed genders, it would have to be <em class="seneca">ësknige’ae’</em>.
    Socially people keep close track of who everyone is related to so that people in the Seneca community always know how they and others are situated in relation to others.
    </p>
    <p>
    Those relationships are understood to be two-way reciprocal exchanges, and for that reason gift-giving is an important way to demonstrate those bonds.
    Each item in the Thanksgiving Address, is that kind of reciprocal communication among relatives: an expression of gratitude for the gifts offered by that person, animal, force, or being that solidifies a two-way relationship.
    </p>
    <p>
    We should note, as an aside, that speakers vary in translating the address as giving thanks <q>for</q> or <q>to</q> the beings, and some are deliberately ambiguous.
    Some speakers are eager to avoid the old Christian accusation of nature-worship, while others even embrace that description.
    Perhaps <q>gratefully acknowledge</q> or even something like <q>pay respects to</q> would be better translations.
    Ja:no’s Bowen stresses that the address is not a Christian-style prayer because the speaker is not asking these entities for anything the way one would beseech a deity.
    Rather, followers of the Haudenosaunee longhouse religion recognize that humans are one part of a larger world of spiritual beings and forces that are known through elements of the visible world.

    <h1>Earth Songs as a Practice of Reciprocal Relationships</h1> 
    <p>
    Earth Songs are a central way for traditional Seneca people to esablish, celebrate, and renew their relationships according to the spirit of <em class="seneca">Gano:nyök</em>.
    Many dances are explicitly linked to specific beings mentioned in the address, and we might extend the concepts a bit to include others, as in <aac:ref type="table" href="#tab:ganonyok-earth_songs" />.
    If we were to include ceremonial songs like those for seasonal celebrations like the Strawberry Festival or those for healing, this table would easily have an entry for every item in the Thanksgiving Address.
    </p>
    <xi:include href="../tables/ganonyok-earth_songs.xhtml" />
    <p>
    Bill teaches that Robin Dance is meant to give thanks to the robin for returning in the spring.
    Likewise he presents Corn Dance as a way of remembering and being thankful for corn throughout its annual growing cycle.
    <!-- TODO quotes -->
    Bill’s daughers spoke about Women’s Dance as a way of connecting both with the Earth and with other women in a long line of dancers stretching back to Sky Woman.
    (Sky Woman fell from the Sky World and landed on the back of a giant turtle; the muskrat and other animals brought up soil from the sea floor for her and she danced in a counterclockwise circle to spread the soil across the turtle’s back and make the world we know.)
    </p>
    <p>
    This relational perspective gives a deeper meaning to descriptions of Earth Songs as <q>social dances</q>.
    Elder Al George describes Earth Songs not only as a form of relaxation, recreation, and simple fun for the community, but also as something that grounds them in who they are and connects them to their ancestors and to the land.
    The community makes the dances and the dances make them.
    They renew relationships to each other and the whole extended, more-than-human family.
    The language of one older New Women’s Shuffle Dance, as paraphrased by singer John Block, says this well:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      What they are doing up there [in the Sky World]<br />
      we are doing down here.<br />
      It’s good fun<br />
      and it makes our minds as one.
      <!-- TODO exact, source -->
    </blockquote>
    <p>
    The circle of dancers on earth mirrors one in the Sky World and joins all together as one community,.
    This is not ceremonial—hence it’s <q>good fun</q>—but compared to some Western views of dancing it’s still quite a sacred concept.
    </p>
    <p>
    Earth Songs make place in the circle for <em class="seneca">Ha’deögwe’da:geh</em>, all different kinds of people, in a beautiful model of inclusion.
    At social dances like the intertribal dances at powwows on Haudenosaunee territory, different body types, genders, ages, tribes, clans, and even settlers are invited and welcomed to join.
    Outside of educational presentations, the normal practice is that there are no spectators for social dancing; it involves the active participation of everyone present who is able-bodied enough to move , and you can generally see everyone from babies to the very elderly jumping, prancing, or barely shuffling one foot in front of the other around the circle.
    This is why Earth Songs have always been used on the literal and figurative <q>Woods’ Edge Clearing</q> to welcome outsiders into the community and enable exchange, as we discuss in the section on intercultural exchange.
    </p>
    <!-- TODO -->
    <p>
    The practice of reciprocity is emphasized in Seneca stories about the origins of Earth Songs.
    As Bill tells the story <a class="internal" href="robin.html">Robin Dance</a> was a gift to humans from the robin.
    Likewise certain dances for the corn (though not the social <a class="interal" href="corn.html">Corn Dance</a>) were gifts from the Corn Spirit to enable a healthier relationship after a period of neglect.
    There are other also stories about ceremonial songs that are not shared publicly, in which someone at the margins of society becomes an intermediary to an animal or other being who gives them songs to take back to the human community.
    In all these cases the animal or spirit knows that humans need a way to relate to it and so give them the song to enable reciprocal relationship.
    </p>
    <p>
    As the animals and beings did for their human family members who would have been helpless without their gifts, likewise did Haudenosaunee people do for the Euro-American guests who came to their territory.
    They adapted the Condolence Council and the woods’-edge protocols to use for treaties.
    Building on the practical symbols that Peacemaker had used to establish
    good relationships among the Six Nations before colonization,
    Haudenosaunee diplomats created the Two-Row Wampum and the image of the
    Covenant Chain to teach the Dutch and later the English how they could work together.

    <h1>Smoke Dance and Cultural Exchange among Native Nations</h1>
    <p>
    Earth Songs have been part of the reciprocal relationships among Haudenosaunee nations since the time of Peacemaker.
    Gatherings of nations for Haudenosaunee councils and treaties all would have included social dances.
    Most of the Earth Songs are fundamentally the same across the Six Nations in both their melodies and their vocable words.
    <!-- TODO confirm -->
    </p>
    <p>
    This is still an area for common ground today.
    At the powwows on Haudenosaunee territory, the normal events of Northern and Southern powwow dance and song, which are rooted in grass dances of the Western plains, are supplemented with Smoke Dance, a distinctively Iroquois addition.
    Starting at the Grand Entry, which at Salamanca and Akwesasne goes is a counterclockwise circle, reverse of the normal practice elsewhere, the falgs are brought in by veterans who lead the dances to the tunes of Haudenosaunee Earth Songs.
    Smoke Dance originated in exhibition shows, in which singers sped up traditional social-dance songs and dancers heightened the traditional moves of War Dance (<em class="seneca">wasa:se’</em>) to create a distinctly Haudenosaunee version of competitive, showy powwow dancing.
    <!-- TODO check spelling -->
    The high, piercing cries of plains powwow songs and their huge drums, and the spiky, feather plains regalia contrast strikingly with the much more mellifluous tunes and singing style of the Haudenosaunee, coupled usually not with water drum but with a larger frame drum.
    The traditional songs are amped up (literally, on the giant powwow PA systems) but not as much as other powwow music.
    The traditional regalia of Haudenosaunee dancers is also plainer, closer to the body, and more modest than the alternatives.
    At Haudenosaunee-hosted powwows there are separate Smoke Dance events including a Haudenosaunee-centered set of exhibitions called the Woodland Special.
    Distinctions between the six Haudenosaunee nations are downplayed to project a sense of pan-Iroquois solidarity.
    For example, Bill Crouse was the featured singer at the Akwesasne Powwow in September 2023 though it was Mohawk territory.
    Mohawk elder Doug George later told me he hears a big difference between Bill’s Seneca singing style and the smoother style of Mohawk singers like his late wife Joanne Shenandoah, but such distinctions are not crucial in the powwow setting.
    </p>
    <p>
    Apart from powwows, Smoke Dance competitions and exhibitions are regular occurrences in Salamanca and elsewhere, with categories for each gender and age group.
    One memorable moment came in a July 2022 Smoke Dance competition at the Seneca-Iroquois National Museum in Salamanca, when in the middle of the Golden Age Men’s dance, a toddler found his way out into the circle and the elderly dancers included him in their dances.
    Unlike other social dances, Smoke Dance competitions do create a distinction between participants and observers.
    There is a seated audience who applaud at the announcer’s invitation after each dance.
    Smoke Dance competitions often feature substantial cash prizes, which encourages participation and also raises the stakes for the audience.
    </p>
    <!-- TODO on powwows during COVID ? -->

    Smoke Dance is one of the only occasions in which Earth Songs are sung in a completely different style and context from their original use.
    When Bill sings Robin Dance for Smoke Dance (one of his favorites for this purpose) it is at nearly double the normal tempo and follows a different structure of repeats.

      <h2>Repurposing Earth Songs for Other Occasions</h2>
      <p>
      Bill has also on occasion repurposed Earth Songs in other settings.
      In summer 2023 he organized an exhibition <q>lacrosse dance</q> which coupled Earth Songs with a choreographed lacrosse exhibition.
      <!-- TODO details, reason, occasion, participants, video/audio? -->
      The event had added significance for Bill because lacrosse has been an important medicinal ceremony for him in particular.

    <h1>The Sing as a Pan-Haudenosaunee Exchange Event</h1>
    <p>
    The event known as a Sing is another pan-Haudenosaunee exchange opportunity.
    Starting in the early twentieth century mutual-aid groups began holding singing competitions to raise money for the needy in the local community, especially widows.
    People would gather from all over for joint-aid work like chopping firewood for the winter.
    In the evenings they would relax by sharing <em class="seneca">Ë:sgä:nye:’</em>, New Women’s Shuffle Dance songs.
    In this setting only the songs were shared, not the dance.
    Singing societies developed like the Allegany Singing Society and these groups competed as they shared sets of Women’s Dance songs contributed by their members.
    </p>
    <p>
    More than other types of Earth Songs, <a class="internal" href="womens.html">Ladies’ Dance</a> songs celebrate human experience and community life.
    Singers make songs expressing everyday experiences.
    Songs shared by the Allegany Singers in a September 2022 recording session included topics of hunting, strawberries, and singing itself.
    <!-- details TODO -->
    Songs are shared and remembered from teachers and relatives, making each set of songs a portrait of local community relationships—a way of remembering the community (see <aac:ref type="video" href="vid:memory-community" />).
    In style, too, these songs engage with contemporary culture, making reference to popular songs, major-key sounding implied harmony, and even polyphony.
    <!-- TODO example if not elsewhere -->
    </p>
    <p>
    Relationships and reciprocity, then, provide the motivation for a Sing as part of community mutual-aid efforts, and they shape the style and subject matter of the songs shared and the ways they are shared.
    The songs remind the community who they are and where they have been, strengthening reciprocal bonds of friendship and family.
    These events also gather people from different territories and Haudenosaunee nations and allow for exchange.

    <p>
    Relationships and reciprocity are also practiced through Earth Songs by including songs from other, non-Haudenosaunee tribes.
    Alligator Dance was a gift from the Mikasuki Nation of Florida.
    <!-- TODO details and corrections -->
    Haudenosaunee singers at intertribal powwows heard the song and liked it, and the Mikasuki singers gave their permission for them to take it back to their own community.
    <!-- NB this is what would be necessary for settlers -->
    Bill Crouse tells how years later he was dismayed when a boy came up to him at a powwow and asked him if he could record the Alligator Dance on his tape recorder.
    The boy's grandmother related to Bill that since the time when the Senecas learned this song, her people had lost it and no one remembered it any more.
    So the Seneca adoption of the song actually led to it being preserved for its original tribe as well.
    </p>
    <p>
    Cherokee Stomp Dance originated with the Haudenosaunee’s more distant Iroquoian-speaking relatives far to the south.
    <!-- TODO details -->
    Delaware Stick Dance came to the Haudenosaunee brought by the many Delaware refugees they harbored after the wars and displacement in the East.
    Like its originators, the dance has become so thoroughly adopted that it is now the traditional closing song in any set of Earth Songs at a social.
    <!-- TODO on the sound => separate page ? -->
    Integrating the song and adopting the people went hand in hand, following the Haudenosaunee concept of <q>extending the rafters</q> to welcome more families into the extended longhouse of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy.
    </p>
    <p>
    Scholars have speculated about intercultural origins of other Earth Songs, though their views are not supported by the Seneca oral tradition.
    Gertrude Kurath suggested that Standing Quiver’s atypical features might indicate a non-Iroquois origin.
    <!-- TODO detail, cite -->
    Kurath and William Fenton developed a theory that the Eagle Dance is <q>an offshoot of the Calumet Dance</q> practiced further west among Anishinaabeg peoples, but we will not discuss it further here because it is a ceremonial dance.
    <!-- TODO cite -->
    (Fenton’s book is paradigmatic of the problem of scholarship that does not
    respect Native categories: it is the only published study that attempts to
    trace the history and comparative study of a Haudenosaunee musical and
    dance practice, but because it deals entirely with restricted ceremonial knowledge, I [Andrew] will not read it out of respect for Seneca protocols.
    No matter how insightful Fenton’s work may seem, its merits are severely undercut by his disregard for his informants’ own beliefs.)
