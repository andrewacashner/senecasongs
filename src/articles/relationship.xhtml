    This project centers around three linked pairs of concepts: Earth/land, history/tradition, and relationship/reciprocity.
    Seneca people, like many other indigenous nations, have traditionally emphasized that all people, animals, and other beings and forces on Earth are connected to each other in reciprocal (two-way) relationships.
    This idea is fundamental to Seneca song and dance practices. 
    As the name suggests, Earth Songs connect people to Mother Earth and all the other beings that draw life from her.
    The songs and dances extend the daily Seneca practice of saying <em class="seneca">Gano:nyök</em>, the Thanksgiving Address that gratefully acknowledges the people’s reciprocal connection to the rest of Creation and its Creator.
    </p>
    <p>
    Seneca oral tradition says that many songs were gifts to people from other beings like the robin or the Corn Spirit, and they were given to enable humans to have healthy, mutual relationships with those beings.
    Likewise, Seneca people have shared songs as a way to allow others to have good relationships with them, including the Haudenosaunee, other Native nations, and settler nations.
    The Earth Song repertoire includes several dances that were borrowed from other Native nations.
    Earth Songs are shared in an event called a Sing in which a song competition is integrated into a communal mutual-aid activity.
    The songs shared build relationships across local communities, between different Haudenosaunee nations, and across generations.
    Another form of Native intercultural sharing happens through Smoke Dance, an adaptation of traditional Earth Songs for the purpose of competitive powwow dancing.
    </p>
    <p>
    These ways of using Earth Songs to build reciprocal relationships stand in stark contrast to the exploitative and abusive uses of music by settler-colonialists throughout Seneca history.
    From mission churches to boarding schools, colonizers sought to eliminate Haudenosaunee traditional songs and replace them with Euro-American music.
    Nevertheless, many Haudenosaunee people still found creative ways to adapt, demonstrating success in Westernized forms while also integrating and adapting their own traditions.
    While anthropologists and scholars have made a few efforts at cataloging, collecting, and analyzing Seneca music, their work has had little impact because it has not reflected Haudenosaunee views or served Haudenosaunee needs.
    </p>
    <p>
    Earth Songs today continue to serve their traditional purpose in fostering reciprocal relationships, as demonstrated by the work of Bill Crouse and other Seneca presenters when they share these songs outside current Seneca territory, including on this site.
    Two images from colonial-era Seneca diplomacy still provide a viable framework for Seneca-settler relationships: the Two-Row Wampum and the Covenant Chain.
    Our work on this project is informed by both concepts.
    These principles were also embodied in an event in summer 2023, in which the town of Caneadea, New York, formally invited the Seneca Nation to establish friendship with them, and celebrated the relationship through an event that centered on Bill Crouse’s group sharing Earth Songs including the Friendship Dance.
    That event gives a glimpse of how Earth Songs might enable a new growth of reciprocal relationships between Native and non-Native peoples.

    <h1><em class="seneca">Gano:nyök</em>: Everything Starts with Gratitude for Relationships</h1>
    <p>
    Every traditional Haudenosaunee formal gathering begins and ends with an address known as <em class="seneca">Gano:nyök</em>, or the Thanksgiving Address.
    This speech is also called The Words before All Else.
    On Seneca territory, the speaker would normally be a male elder, and each speaker would give his own version of the address reflecting the circumstances of time and place, but always following a set traditional pattern.
    </p>
    <p>
    <aac:TODO note="cite sources including Kimmerer">
    The speaker begins the address by inviting all present to join their minds as one with him in giving thanks, and then begins to move through a series of thanksgivings addressed to different beings or elements of the world.
    The first element is always <em class="seneca">ha’deögwe’da:geh</em>, all the different kinds of people.
    </aac:TODO>
    Next the speaker thanks Our Mother the Earth, and then acknowledges, in ,
    the waters, medicinal plants, grasses, berries, strawberries, the Three Sisters (corn, beans, and squash), forests, the maple trees, animals, birds, Our Elder Brother the Sun and Our Grandmother the Moon, the stars, the winds, and others, concluding with <em class="seneca">Shögwajënö’kda’öh</em>, Our Creator.
    </p>
    <p>
    The Thanksgiving Address provides traditional Seneca people with one of their most central concepts and tools for thinking and making sense of the world.
    <aac:TODO note="image, link">
    For example, the Seneca-Iroquois National Museum in Salamanca is entirely organized according to Gano:nyök.
    </aac:TODO>
    Visitors move in the traditional Haudenosaunee counterclockwise circle through exhibits highlighting the different parts of the address, and the other topics on history, arts, and dance are organized in relationship to those parts.
    <aac:TODO note="cite">
    The Seneca intellectual John Mohawk used the address as the organizing structure for several of his writings, rather the way Christian theologians used the Apostles’ Creed or the Lord’s Prayer to structure their works.
    </aac:TODO>
    Ja:no’s Bowen, director of the Seneca Language Department on the Allegany Territory, starts and ends all of her language class sessions with some version of Gano:nyök.
    In her classes (which Andrew attended 2020–2024) she uses the Thanksgiving Address as a source of vocabulary, grammar, and a focal point for teaching Seneca values and worldview.
    </p>
    <p>
    <aac:TODO note="cite Mohawk, Shenandoah, Kimmerer, Fixico, Broyles-Gonzalez">
    The Thanksgiving Address provides the particular Seneca way of centering life in a web of reciprocal relationships, as most other indigenous American nations do.
    </aac:TODO>
    Humans are understood to be lesser, weaker members of a larger extended family that includes non-human creatures, animals, and plants, and beyond-human beings like the spirits of sun, moon, and stars, within a worldview where, as John Mohawk says, everything that is real has spirit and can be related to as a being.
    </p>
    <p>
    The Seneca language used in the address aids in this way of thinking because the grammar requires constant attention to relationships.
    The speaker addresses not <q>Earth</q> generally but <em class="seneca">Ëthino’ëh yöëdzade’</em>, where the <em>ethi-</em> prefix means a relation of all of us to her—<q><em>Our</em> Mother the Earth</q>.
    Likewise for the <em class="seneca">shogwa-</em> in <q>Our Creator</q>.
    <aac:TODO note="cite grammar, dictionary">
    There are fifteen nominative pronouns in Seneca and some thirty transitive pronouns that convey highly specific relationships.
    </aac:TODO>
    For example, the everyday equivalent of goodbye is <em class="seneca">ësgöge’ae’</em> (I will see you again), but only if the speaker is addressing a single person.
    <aac:TODO note="check with Ja:no’s">
    To say goodbye to two people (but not more) of mixed genders, it would have to be <em class="seneca">ësknige’ae’</em>; saying farewell to a whole group would be <em class="seneca">ësgwage’gae’</em>
    </aac:TODO>
    The language aligns with a cultural pattern in which people generally keep close track of who everyone is related to.
    A member of the Seneca community always knows how they and others are situated in relation to others.
    </p>
    <p>
    Those relationships are understood to be two-way reciprocal exchanges, and for that reason gift-giving is an important way to demonstrate those bonds.
    Each item in the Thanksgiving Address, is that kind of reciprocal communication among relatives: an expression of gratitude for the gifts offered by that person, animal, force, or being that solidifies a two-way relationship.
    Some speakers translate the address as giving thanks <em>for</em> the elements of the world, perhaps to avoid the old Christian accusation of nature-worship, while others have no problem saying they are giving thanks <em>to</em> the beings.
    Ja:no’s Bowen stresses that the address is not a Christian-style prayer because the speaker is not asking these entities for anything the way one would beseech a deity.
    Perhaps <q>gratefully acknowledge</q> or even something like <q>pay respects to</q> would be better translations.
    Either way, followers of the Handsome Lake longhouse religion recognize that humans are one part of a larger world of spiritual beings and forces that are known through elements of the visible world.

    <h1>Earth Songs as a Practice of Reciprocal Relationships</h1> 
    <p>
    Earth Songs are a central way for traditional Seneca people to establish, celebrate, and renew these relationships according to the spirit of Gano:nyök.
    <aac:TODO note="check gaps with Bill">
    Many dances are explicitly linked to specific beings mentioned in the address, and we might extend the concepts a bit to include others,

    Bill teaches that Robin Dance is meant to give thanks to the robin for returning in the spring.
    Likewise he presents Corn Dance as a way of remembering and being thankful for corn throughout its annual growing cycle.
    Bill’s daughers spoke about Women’s Dance as a way of connecting both with the Earth and with other women in a long line of dancers stretching back to Sky Woman.
    </aac:TODO>
    <aac:TODO note="source">
    (Sky Woman fell from the Sky World and landed on the back of a giant turtle; the muskrat and other animals brought up soil from the sea floor for her and she danced in a counterclockwise circle to spread the soil across the turtle’s back and make the world we know.)
    </aac:TODO>
    </p>
    <p>
    This relational perspective gives a deeper meaning to descriptions of Earth Songs as <q>social dances</q>.
    <aac:TODO note="quote, video">Elder Al George</aac:TODO> describes Earth Songs not only as a form of relaxation, recreation, and simple fun for the community, but also as something that grounds them in who they are and connects them to their ancestors and to the land.
    The community makes the dances and the dances make them.
    They renew relationships to each other and the whole extended, more-than-human family.
    The language of one older New Women’s Shuffle Dance, as paraphrased by singer John Block, says this well:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <aac:TODO note="check; video/audio">
      What they are doing up there [in the Sky World]<br />
      we are doing down here.<br />
      It’s good fun<br />
      and it makes our minds as one.
      </aac:TODO>
    </blockquote>
    <p class="continue">
    The circle of dancers on earth mirrors one in the Sky World and joins all together as one community.
    The words are describing social dancing that is <q>good fun</q> rather than a solemn ceremony, but compared to some Western views of dancing it’s still quite a sacred concept.
    </p>
    <p>
    Earth Songs make place in the circle for <em class="seneca">Ha’deögwe’da:geh</em>, all different kinds of people, in a beautiful model of inclusion.<aac:TODO note="photo, from video?">
    At social dances like the intertribal dances at powwows on Haudenosaunee territory, different body types, genders, ages, tribes, clans, and even settlers are invited and welcomed to join.
    </aac:TODO>
    Outside of educational presentations, the normal practice is that there are no spectators for social dancing.
    A social dance involves the active participation of everyone present who is able-bodied enough to move.
    The dances are structured loosely enough that everyone can participate in their own way, from babies being carried to athletic young people to the very elderly who can barely shuffle one foot in front of the other.
    This is why Earth Songs have always been used on the literal and figurative <q>Woods’ Edge Clearing</q> to welcome outsiders into the community and enable exchanges among Native nations and with settlers.
    </p>
    <p>
    The practice of reciprocity is emphasized in Seneca stories about the origins of Earth Songs.
    As Bill tells the story <a class="internal" href="robin.html">Robin Dance</a> was a gift to humans from the robin.
    Likewise certain dances for the corn (though not the social <a class="interal" href="corn.html">Corn Dance</a>) were gifts from the Corn Spirit to enable a healthier relationship after a period of neglect.
    <aac:TODO note="Check with Bill">
    Without sharing the details, Bill also notes that there are also stories about private ceremonial songs in which someone at the margins of society becomes an intermediary to an animal or other being who gives them songs to take back to the human community.
    </aac:TODO>
    In all these cases the animal or spirit knows that humans need a way to relate to it and so give them the song to enable reciprocal relationship.
    </p>
    <p>
    As the animals and beings did for their human family members who would have been helpless without their gifts, likewise did Haudenosaunee people do for the Euro-American guests who came to their territory.
    They adapted the Condolence Council and the woods’-edge protocols to use for treaties.

    Building on the practical symbols that Peacemaker had used to establish

    <h1>Earth Songs and Reciprocity in Local Communities: The Sing</h1>
    <p>
    Earth Songs build relationships in local Seneca communities whenever they are shared, but the aspect of reciprocity is highlighted especially in the event known as a Sing.
    <aac:TODO note="sources (include podcast)">
    Starting in the early twentieth century mutual-aid groups began holding singing competitions to raise money for the needy in the local community, especially widows.
    </aac:TODO>
    People would gather from all over for joint-aid work like chopping firewood for the winter.
    In the evenings they would relax by sharing <em class="seneca">Ë:sgä:nye:’</em>, New Women’s Shuffle Dance songs.
    In this setting only the songs were shared, not the dance.
    Singing societies developed like the Allegany Singing Society and these groups competed as they shared sets of Women’s Dance songs contributed by their members.
    The songs document and preserve relationships among singers, between teachers and students, and between different towns and territories.
    </p>
    <p>
    More than other types of Earth Songs, <a class="internal" href="womens.html">Ladies’ Dance</a> songs celebrate human experience and community life, as we explain elsewhere.
    Singers make songs expressing everyday experiences.
    Songs shared by the Allegany Singers in a September 2022 recording session included topics of hunting, strawberries, and singing itself.
    <aac:TODO note="examples">Songs</aac:TODO> are shared and remembered from teachers and relatives, making each set of songs a portrait of local community relationships—a way of remembering the community (see <aac:ref type="video" href="vid:memory-community" />).
    In style, too, these songs engage with contemporary culture, making reference to popular songs, major-key sounding implied harmony, and even polyphony.
    </p>
    <p>
    Relationships and reciprocity, then, provide the motivation for a Sing as part of community mutual-aid efforts, and they shape the style and subject matter of the songs shared and the ways they are shared.
    The songs remind the community who they are and where they have been, strengthening reciprocal bonds of friendship and family.

    As Bill Crouse tells the story, Haudenosaunee singers at intertribal powwows heard the song and liked it, and the Miccosukee singers gave their permission for them to take it back to their own community.
    <!-- NB this is what would be necessary for settlers -->
    Bill Crouse tells how years later he was dismayed when a boy came up to him at a powwow and asked him if he could record the Alligator Dance on his tape recorder.
    The boy's grandmother related to Bill that since the time when the Senecas learned this song, her people had lost it and no one remembered it any more.

      The story of Alligator Dance reveals much about Seneca concepts of music and provides a model for those who wish to share their music, especially settlers.
      Singers of both Seneca and Miccosukee nations understood the dance neither as a copyright individual creation nor as something in the public domain.
      Rather, the dance belonged to the nation.
      The dance could be shared as a gift from nation to nation, with the appropriate permission.
      the seneca singers could have simply recorded or memorized the dance and copied it on their own, but they would have viewed that as inappropriate, so they asked for permission.
      Instead of some kind of business transaction, they began a reciprocal relationship that has continued to the present.

    <h1>Smoke Dance and Cultural Exchange among Native Nations</h1>
    <p>
    Today powwows on Haudenosaunee territory have become one of the main sites for sharing Earth Songs between Haudenosaunee nations, among Native nations, and with settlers.
    At the Salamanca and Akwesasne powwows, the Grand Entry goes in a counterclockwise circle, reverse of the normal practice elsewhere, and is led by the veterans bearing the flags while the singers sing Earth Songs.
    The normal events of Northern and Southern powwow dance and song are rooted in grass dances of the Western plains, but the powwows on Haudenosaunee territory they are supplemented with the distinctively Iroquois competition category of Smoke Dance.
    </p>
    <p>
    Smoke Dance originated in exhibition shows, in which singers sped up traditional social-dance songs and dancers heightened the traditional moves of War Dance (<em class="seneca">wasa:se’</em>) to create a unique Haudenosaunee version of competitive, showy powwow dancing.
    <!-- TODO check spelling -->
    The high, piercing cries of plains powwow songs and their huge drums, and the spiky, feather plains regalia contrast strikingly with the much more mellifluous tunes and singing style of the Haudenosaunee, coupled usually not with water drum but with a larger frame drum.
    The traditional songs are amped up (literally, on the giant powwow PA systems) but not as much as other powwow music.
    The traditional regalia of Haudenosaunee dancers is also plainer, closer to the body, and more modest than the alternatives.
    At Haudenosaunee-hosted powwows there are separate Smoke Dance events including a Haudenosaunee-centered set of exhibitions called the Woodland Special.
    </p>
    <p>
    Smoke Dance allows Haudenosaunee dancers to present their own distinct heritage in the context of an intertribal gathering.
    A powwow is in one sense a diplomatic event, a kind of congress of Native nations projecting an alternative, anticolonial vision of North America as an indigenous-dominated Turtle Island.
    Smoke Dance builds on earlier traditions of Haudenosaunee diplomacy.
    Earth Songs have been part of the reciprocal relationships among Haudenosaunee nations since the time of Peacemaker.

    Gatherings of nations for Haudenosaunee councils and treaties all would have included social dances.

    Distinctions between the six Haudenosaunee nations are downplayed, therefore, to project a sense of pan-Iroquois solidarity.

    </p>
    <p>
    Apart from powwows, Smoke Dance competitions and exhibitions are regular occurrences in Salamanca and elsewhere, with categories for each gender and age group.
    One memorable moment came in a July 2022 Smoke Dance competition at the Seneca-Iroquois National Museum in Salamanca, when in the middle of the Golden Age Men’s dance, a toddler found his way out into the circle and the elderly dancers included him in their dances.
    Unlike other social dances, Smoke Dance competitions do create a distinction between participants and observers.
    There is a seated audience who applaud at the announcer’s invitation after each dance.
    Smoke Dance competitions often feature substantial cash prizes, which encourages participation and also raises the stakes for the audience.
    </p>
    <p>
    Smoke Dance is one of a few occasions in which Earth Songs are sung in a completely different style and context from their original use.
    <aac:TODO note="confirm, quantify">

    <aac:TODO note="citations">Elsewhere</aac:TODO> missionaries actively adapted local forms (as the Jesuits did in

    colonial Mexican church music.
    But both Catholic and Protestant colonizers in Haudenosaunee country treated their <q>subjects</q> like ignorant, wild children with nothing worth preserving in their own culture.
    Euro-Americans sought to impose their own music on Haudenosaunee people.
    The few settler anthropologists who took an interest in Haudenosaunee song made only superficial observations based on recordings that remain buried in archives, while demonstrating little interest in giving back to the communities they studied.

    As we discuss elsewhere under the heading of <a class="internal" href="tradition.html">Tradition and History</a>, European and Euro-American visitors to Haudenosaunee territory in the first centuries after contact observed songs and dances that sound like Earth Songs.
    That makes sense since these songs were already part of Haudenosaunee
    protocols for welcoming outsiders.
    I (Andrew) have not encountered any evidence of Euro-American colonizers taking any interest in learning or understanding Haudenosaunee songs or dances before Lewis Henry Morgan in the early nineteenth century.

    There were early attempts to translate the Bible, Christian liturgy, and hymns into Haudenosaunee languages, starting with the Mohawk since the Europeans encountered that nation earliest.
    <!-- TODO list sources -->
    There was not a published hymn book in Seneca until missionary Asher Wright, stationed on the Buffalo Creek reservation, began publishing a Seneca-language newspaper and books in the mid-nineteenth century.
    <!-- TODO details -->
    Like other Christian-Native translations in this region, Wright created indigenous words to fit existing Euro-American tunes.
    Whether Seneca people made any contribution to those words, how the translation of Christian concepts adapted existing Haudenosaunee ideas, how the poetic diction related to Seneca oral forms, all remain to be investigated by someone competent in both Seneca and Christian hymnody and theology.
    A further question is how Seneca congregations actually sang these tunes, and whether there are still-continuous traditions today like those of the Oneida Hymn Singers in Wisconsin.
    <!-- TODO cites -->
    It would be fascinating to investigate how Seneca concepts of vocality, rhythm, bodily movement, and other aspects of music transferred into Christian hymn singing, and whether they may have been traditional or new original Seneca tunes included in these collections in some form.
    In the case of the Oneida Hymn Singers, it is notable that their practice, though thoroughly Christian in its hymnological and theological aspects, closely follows the same deeply traditional Haudenosaunee social patterns: the hymn singers are effectively a mutual-aid society that primarily organizes to sing at funerals and provide hope and comfort to the mourning.
    The singers’ Haudenosaunee ancestors also adapted traditional mourning practices for a new purpose when they converted the Condolence Council into the standard form for Euro-American treaty meetings.
    The same values of community mutual support later gave rise to traditional Sings.
    Other connections, such as the role of gender in these groups, the style and methods of leadership, and the use of oral tradition, all merit further study.
    Most importantly, it should be asked how Haudenosaunee concepts of reciprocity and relationship changed when people and communities converted to Christianity, how those changes differed depending on the denomination of Christianity, and how these new concepts manifested through singing.

    Christian hymn singing is only one example of Haudenosaunee people finding their own musical paths through settler-claimed territory.
    The Jesuits apparently trained Haudenosaunee converts to play violin and flute and assist at Mass.
    Episcopal and other Protestant churches needed local organists, and given how different surviving traditions of Haudenosaunee-language hymnody are from settler norms, those keyboardists would have needed to understand those local forms of musicality in order to support them appropriately.
    <!-- TODO facts -->
    Wind bands were common across Iroquoia in the nineteenth century, and though the music they played was likely the same sort as played by settler bands, it seems likely that their social organization and functions followed distinctive Haudenosaunee patterns, just as the hymn-singing societies have done.
    The Six Nations have produced numerous professional musicians, from early boarding school graduates to Robbie Robertson.
    As the documentary film <cite>Rumble</cite> argues, the four-on-the-floor drum beat of rock music likely owes as much to Native music than it does to African American music.

    In other cases musical imposition did not result in this kind of synthesis but in silence.
    <!-- Doug George: music and sound at the Mohawk Institute -->
    According to Doug George, a survivor of the Mohawk Institute on the Six Nations Reserve in Ontario, Canada, the sonic world of boarding schools was a central part of its traumatic impact. 
    Quiet was enforced most of the time and children were punished severely for speaking Native languages.
    The only singing anyone was allowed to hear or do was at church on Sundays.
    All night long students lay in bed listening to the sounds of abuse happening as sounds of protest and pain floated up the stairwells to the student dormitory on the top floor.
    Very occasionally the radio was played or a record player brought in.
    But given the central place of Earth Songs, not to mention ceremonial songs, in Haudenosaunee communities, it must have been disorienting and incapacitating for children to be completely removed from that sonic world.
    The regimentation of the body in the boarding schools was a key reason dancing was forbidden, and as with the sonic experience of the ears, Haudenosaunee children’s bodies were never used to being completely still.
    Even at ceremonies children would be moving about and playing.
    Haudenosaunee dancing depends on free, natural body movements, not holding of artificial poses.
    Having to sit rigidly still and sing hymns was—by design—a disorienting, identity-negating experience.
    Morgan had said that dance was so important to the Haudenosaunee that should they ever stop dancing they would cease to be Indians, and that was precisely the goal of the boarding schools, to <q>kill the Indian to save the man</q>. Something more opposed to traditional Haudenosaunee values of reciprocity could hardly be devised.
    </p>
    <p>
    For the same reason, the colonial governments banned Native dance and ceremony at various points.
    <!-- TODO facts -->
    </p>
    <p>
    Ironically the restrictions on Native musical expression coincided with the rise of interest in recording and preserving Native music among anthropologists and the music scholars who would later call themselves ethnomusicologists.
    In relation to the Haudenosaunee, only a handful of settler scholars have ever tried to document Earth Songs and fewer have tried to understand them.
    Morgan described a core subset of dances but only gave vague descriptions of how the songs sounded, including one single measure of music notation.
    An official in Ontario notated a few tunes at the end of the nineteenth century, and these remained the only notated Haudenosaunee music until Gertrude Kurath’s studies in the 1950s.
    <!-- TODO name, details --> 
    Kurath by her own account transcribed hundreds of Haudenosaunee song melodies and dance choreographies in her own notation system, based primarily on her first-hand observations at Six Nations, and on audio recordings of Allegany singers by Fenton.
    Of those she only published snippets of songs along with analytical diagrams.
    In the cases where I (Andrew) have been able to identify the song she was transcribing or even the specific recording, it can be hard to see the relationship between the sound and her notation.
    Her notations, like so many others of Native music, greatly oversimplified the rhythms and melodic inflections.
    </p>
    <!-- TODO Barbeau collection -->
    <p>
    Fenton published some his recordings through Smithsonian Folkways, even though he knew that many of them were ceremonial.
    Certainly attitudes have changed toward the more restrictive on the Allegany territory since that time, largely in response to Fenton, but even then the medicinal chants were understood to be efficacious, powerful treatments, not just tunes to be queued up on the turntable.
    Meanwhile hundreds of other recordings by Fenton, along with others by William Sturtevant, remain in archives, largely unheard and unstudied.
    </p>
    <p>
    Once any settler notates Native music it enters into a new life as a commodity in settler culture, divorced from its original context.
    Especially before CD recordings and then YouTube, it was too hard for settlers to get access to the oral tradition, so they relied on what they could find in books.
    An official in Ontario notated the first Haudenosaunee songs in a government research report.
    <!-- details, example TODO -->
    From there those written versions were adpated into a set of parlor-song arrangements.
    <!-- details, example TODO -->
    The arrangements kept only the basic outline of pitches and rhythmic proportions and otherwise transformed the songs into nineteenth-century American sentimental songs with full piano accompaniment and invented pseudo-Native words by a white author.
    This example is hardly recognizable as derived from Shake-the-Bush.
    </p>
    <p>
    Recordings later came to serve a similar purpose—facilitating white appropriations by people without access to the original sources.
    Colin McPhee made an orchestral arrangement of Corn Dance from a recording by Fenton.
    <!-- TODO details -->
    He only used the first minute of the recording, which is a bit like quoting only the first sentence of a Shakespeare play.
    </p>
    <p>
    These appropriations exemplify the patterns of superficial white uses of second- and third-hand verisons of Native music without regard for their context and original significance.
    They are attempts to extract the raw ore from native mines with no effrot to actually connect with people.
    They force Native music into a settler aesthetic framework.
    The arrangements imply that the original was not sufficient on its one, but only raw material for <q>real</q> music made by a Western composer, as Dylan Robinson has argued.
    </p>
    <p>
    Haudenosaunee people have escaped the worst examples of this pattern by not sharing their music more widely and especially restricting people from putting it into a fixed Western form beyond Haudenosaunee control.
    Meanwhile they have made the best of the situation by using settler scholar’s recordings and recording technology as an aid to their own oral traditions.
    The Allegany Singers recorded two versions of Standing Quiver in September 2022, one led by Bill Crouse and based on continuous oral tradition, and the other led by Jake George and based on recordings that captured an earlier version of the tradition.
    Archival recordings that were not supposed to leave the archive have had a way of showing up on the reservation and then being copied widely.
    Bill recounted the efforts over years to preserve a particular set of ceremonial songs where living singers could only remember a portion of the original song list.
    But when previously unknown archival recordings of Bill’s teachers were discovered they were able to recover all but the last of the original set of songs.
    </p>
    <p>
    Settler approaches to Haudenosaunee music in general were anti-reciprocal in that they either ignored Haudenosaunee people, took what they wanted and used it for their own purposes without returning anything, or actively did harm to them by restricting their traditional expressions and attempting to re-educate them.

      The woods’ edge clearing was the meeting place of local insiders and visiting outsiders.
      Approaching visitors sang as they approached a village, and village residents began preparing for their meeting when they could hear them singing through the woods.
      They met at the edge of the woods and the locals greeted their visitors with a protocol based on the ceremonies for condoling the grieving, which included songs.
      They ritually wiped the tears from their eyes, opened their ears, and cleared the block in their throats caused by the griefs and hardships of the journey.
      This prepared both parties to receive each other and enter into relationship with a Good Mind.
      </p>
      <!-- TODO check, details -->
      <p>
      Once the guests were welcomed into the community, the outsiders would often be invited to participate in a community social dance in the evening.
      Starting with Standing Quiver, the lead singer would recruit the other singers and in turn draw the whole village into the dance.
      The songs and dances solidified the reciprocal connections among everyone present.
      </p>
      <p>
      Earth Songs have continued that relational function up to the present day.
      Today the woods’ edge is found not only at the edge of a city or a reservation boundary, but at the meeting place of Seneca people following traditional and not-so-traditional Seneca lifestyles and religious practice, those living on and off territory, as well as indigenous and non-indigenous people.
      It is a place where past and present, history and tradition, meet; where old relationships can be strengthened and new relationships formed.

      <h2>Sharing the Land in Caneadea</h2>
      <p>
      Social dance was a crucial element of an important intercultural and diplomatic event in Caneadea, New York, in July 2023.
      The town government of Caneadea reached out to the Seneca Nation government and asked how they could formally establish friendship—something that had never happened before.
      After a year-long process of collaborative planning their efforts culminated in the Canedea Field Day.
      <!-- TODO date details -->
      </p>
      <p>
      Caneadea has been the site of one of the Seneca Nation’s reservations, one of the last ones they lost before ending up with just the territories they occupy now.
      <!-- TODO years details -->
      In a large field on the west bank of the Genesee River that was part of that reservation, on a hot day in midsummer, there was a formal ceremony followed by social dancing and a lacrosse demonstration game.
      Vendors and exhibitors from the Seneca Nation set up tents all across the field.
      The ceremony included speeches by Caneadea and Seneca Nation officials including SNI president Ricky Armstrong.
      Gifts were exchanged that had been custom-made for this occasion.
      <!-- TODO details -->
      </p>
      <p>
      Bill sang the <q>Haudenosaunee anthem</q> created by his great-grandfather as they raised the Seneca Nation flag next to a town flag.
      <!-- TODO details -->
      Notably, they did not fly a New York State flag, the US flag, or the Haudenosaunee Hiawatha-belt flag, as the agreement of friendship was only between the town of Caneadea and the Seneca Nation of Indians.
      There was a humility and a specificity to that that reflected the relational understanding on both sides.
      This was certainly a political event but it was very specific to the communities involved.
      </p>
      <p>
      A mixed but largely white crowd listened to the speeches and many joined in the social dancing.
      Bill, Al George, and Jacob Dowdy sang as Bill’s group (mostly consisting of his extended family) danced.
      The first dance was a Friendship Dance followed by a typical social set starting with Standing Quiver and including New Women’s Shuffle Dance.
      </p>
      <!-- TODO Bill’s thoughts -->
      <p>
      I (Andrew) was struck by how much of the language used in the speeces stretched back to eighteenth-century treaty sessions—the Covenant Chain, the Tree of Peace, and other metaphors were foundational.
      Likewise the whole event, helt in a literal woods’ edge clearing, seemed almost to reverse the old ceremony in that it was not Seneca people welcoming outsiders to their village but settlers welcoming Senecas back to their own land, now as guests.
      One YouTube commenter titled the day, <q>Caneadea—The Return</q>.
      </p>
      <p>
      But one could also read it the other way.
      Here as in the eighteenth century, the settlers had few protocols that would suffice.
      The Senecas assumed the main burden of ceremony.
      Two hundred years later somehow it was still the Senecas creating a dance circle and inviting whites to join in friendship, welcoming settlers to step onto familiar land with a new understanding—that the settlers had been the guests all along.
      Seeing the land shared like that, if only for a day, raised the question: if Seneca people retained hunting and fishing rights over the lands they ceded because they understood the land fundamentally to be unsellable and its resources available to all, if land <em>use</em> was understood as the main priority, not legal land ownership, what would be the difference between sharing the land like this and giving it back?
      </p>
      <p>
      In this event all three of this project’s dialectic themes come together.
      <em>Earth and land</em> define not just Mother Earth or the Genesee valley in themselves, but reciprocal relationships with <q><em>Our</em> Mother the Earth</q> through a specific place.
      <q>The Creator’s Game</q>, lacrosse, was played probably on that very field in Caneadea, for centuries before <q>the return</q> last July.
      The Fish Dance songs sung on that day were made to honor the same fish swimming in the Genesee only a few hundred yards away.
      </p>
      <p>
      <em>History and tradition</em> are at play here because of the way traditional ceremonies, metaphors, songs, and dances, were used to shape a historic event and respond to the history of that place.
      Several of Bill’s choices were rooted in history: the flag song, Friendship Dance, Standing Quiver.
      But the whole event responded to history by creating a new tradition: this event is intended to recur annually.
      The answer to a cycle of betrayal and abuse is a new cycle of trust and friendship.
      People forget that places are defined by how we use them, and we can therefore start using them differently.
      </p>
      <!-- TODO Indigenous people's day rochester -->
      <p>
      Seneca Earth Songs provide a third image of settler-Native relationships in addition to the Two Row wampum and the Covenant Chain: the circle of dance.
      Where the Two-Row emphasizes separateness but also sharing; the Covenant Chain emphasizes dependency, legal bonds, and reciprocal mutual obligation; the Friendship Dance emphasizes movement, energy, embodiment—sharing the same space, dancing on the same Earth, moving forward but also staying in a traditional circle, connected to ancient, ongoing, eternal patterns of seasons.
      Hence, <q>the Return</q>: another turn around the same circle of settler-Native relationships, an ongoing dance now centuries old, but somehow just beginning.

      <h2>The Relational Goals of This Project</h2>
      <p>
      The <cite>Songs at the Woods’ Edge</cite> project is explicitly intended to contribute to reciprocal relationships between Seneca people like Bill and their settler guests like Andrew.
      Much as we are concerned about harmful appropriations, we are more worried about erasure and ignorance.
      Better to make good, authentic material available with proper context than to allow people to continue thinking Haudenosaunee people exist only in history books, if that.
      </p>
      <p>
      For me (Andrew) this project provides a way to polish the Covenant Chain of friendship that my own ancenstors passed on to me, whether they knew it or not.
      What I initially envisioned as a traditional Western research project, where I extract sources from the field like minerals and then refine them into a scholarly product, turned into something much more interesting, rewarding, challenging, and unpredictable—a relationship.
