    <em class="seneca">Ë:sgä:nye:’</em> or New Women’s Shuffle Dance, a dance for women only, is both the oldest and the newest of Seneca Earth Songs
    <aac:paren><aac:ref type="video" href="#vid:womens-caneadea" /></aac:paren>.
    In the Haudenosaunee Creation story, Sky Woman falls from the Sky World onto the back of a giant turtle, and after the animals finally figure out how to bring up mud and put it on the turtle’s back;
    as Bill Crouse’s daughter Ashlyn explains, Sky Woman <q>dances in a counterclockwise circle, shuffling her feet to work it in, and the earth grew and grew into what we call North America</q>
    <aac:citation key="CrouseAshlyn:Interview-2023_09" />.
    </p>
    <p>
    When women dance <em class="seneca">Ë:sgä:nye:’</em> today, they are joining in that original circle and renewing the earth.
    For this reason, the dance is called New because unlike for other Earth Songs, tradition allows singers to invent new songs for this dance.
    Singing societies gather at a Sing and present sets of Women’s Dance songs that they exchange, and built up their own repertoire of songs by ancestors, teachers, and friends.
    Singers make songs with Seneca words that talk about their own experiences and with tunes that may draw on other contemporary music, as long as it fits the basic beat and structure of the dance.

    <h1>Words and Stories</h1>
    <p>
    People make Ë:sgä:nye:’ about everyday life experiences, elements of the natural world like water or strawberries, traditional teachings, and many other topics.
    Many of the words and melodies came to the makers’ minds all at once, sometimes in dreams, while other songs were more deliberately constructed.
    Many Women’s Dance songs use vocables like other social-dance songs, especially the ending phrase <em class="seneca">gai:nawea:h he:ah</em>.
    But many more songs of this type use Seneca language.
    Some of the lyrics are reminiscent of a haiku: a pithy expression of a specific concept or image in just a few lines.
    Songmakers take full advantage of the capacity of the Seneca language to pack a sentence worth of meaning into a few words.
    For example, in the anonymous older song introduced in our discussion of Relationship and Reciprocity, the maker conveys one of the core purposes of Earth Songs with the one word <em class="seneca">deyögwada’nigöëwë:nye:h</em>, literally <q>we are stirring our own minds</q> or perhaps better translated <q>we are occupying our minds</q>.

    In September 2022 members of the Allegany Singers recorded a set of Ë:sgä:nye:’ at the cookhouse next to the Coldspring Longhouse
    <aac:paren><aac:ref type="video" href="#vid:womens-coldspring" /></aac:paren>, and shared about the meaning and stories of the songs
    <aac:paren><aac:ref type="video" href="#vid:womens-coldspring-interview" /></aac:paren>.
    Together they paint a picture of the Allegany Territory as a site of intense creativity over many decades, as singers competed to present the best set of Women’s Dance songs at Sings while learning and preserving each others’ songs.
    They have continued making new songs while still singing ones from their teachers and even older, now anonymous, songs they call <q>Used-to-Be Songs</q>.
    The Allegany community was notable for <q>passing the drum</q> and allowing the younger men to contribute their own songs to the sets, as the Allegany Singers did in the set we recorded, whereas on other territories there tends to be one main singer who makes or selects the songs for the group.

    <p>
    In July 2024 John Block, Seneca singer and language teacher at the Seneca
    Nation’s Faithkeeper School in Steamburg, New York, sang three Ë:sgä:nye:’ for Bill and Andrew and explained their words and the stories behind them
    <aac:paren><aac:ref type="video" href="#vid:womens-block" /></aac:paren>.
    The songs he selected are a song made by Arthur Johnny-John in the 1950s about the looming Kinzua Dam tragedy, an anonymous older song about Handsome Lake’s prophecies of the end of the world, and a song he himself made for the close of a Sing.
    For John, remembering each song pulled up a wealth of knowledge both about Seneca history, religion, and values.
    Where many Women’s Dance songs are <q>good fun</q> and emphasize enjoying life, the first two songs John chose show a deeper, darker, and more philosophical side.
    The Kinzua Dam Song is a snapshot of a community in crisis, dealing with the trauma before its full force had even hit; the first line says, <q>They are abusing us,</q> or John suggests a better translation might be, <q>They are raping us.</q>

      <figCaption>John Block sings and tells the stories of three Ë:sgä:nye:’ songs</figCaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
    The songs John shared also called to mind the people who taught them to him, when they used to sing them, and the stories they told about them.
    Bill told a story about singing an Ë:sgä:nye:’ for his teacher, and asking if he had heard it before, when it turned out that the song had actually been made by his teacher.
    John told a story about someone else singing a song for him that they heard sung at a Sing and were impressed with, and the other person did not know it was actually a song John had made.
    </p>
    <p>
    The last song John shared also highlighted the creative relationship with <a class="internal" href="tradition.html">tradition</a> that is cultivated in Women’s Dance songs: for a song he designed to be sung at the end of a Sing as a kind of festive recessional, he borrowed a portion of a <a class="internal" href="quiver.html"><em class="seneca">Ga’da:šot</em></a>, the centuries-old marching dance that traditionally starts a social.
    John says that his own preferences have always tended toward the older
    songs and styles, and
    He worries, though, that essential information about the old songs is being
    lost as fewer people know the language.
    He cited a recent experience where a singing group was singing garbled
    versions of songs that they learned phonetically from recordings without
    knowing the actual words or their meaning.
    At the same time, he remains hopeful about the future of Seneca music and praises the enthusiasm of the younger generation that is adapting Ë:sgä:nye:’ in its own new ways.
    In this way Women’s Dance remains true to its traditional connection to Sky Woman and the ongoing, circular process of creation.

      <h2>Musical Structure</h2>
      <p>
      Analyzing many variations of formal patterns, melodic contours and pitch collections, and rhythms of Ë:sgä:nye:’ across the years, would require a separate study, as would understanding the many ways the makers of these songs have incorporated references to other Earth Songs and even non-Seneca music.
      We may briefly note, though, that most Women’s Dance songs use a <q>major</q> diatonic pitch collection.
      Four Ë:sgä:nye:’ recorded by Jake George, Bill Crouse, and the Allegany Singers all used six-note collections, same as the major scale without the seventh-degree leading tone (<aac:ref type="table" href="#tab:womens-sky_world-pitches" />).
      </p>
      <xi:include href="../tables/womens-sky_world-pitches.xhtml" />
      <p>
      In formal pattern, these songs start with a <q>lead</q> phrase, sung by the leader solo, and then the whole group repeats that phrase.
      A contrasting phrase follows, often emphasizing different pitches than the lead phrase.
      This phrase often concludes with an echo of the ending of the lead phrase, making an <em>ab cb</em> pattern.

    At a social, Ë:sgä:nye:’ is danced exclusively by women.
    They use a simple shuffling step that stays close to the earth, as Bill’s daughters demonstrated in a dance at the reconstructed longhouse at Ganondagan

    <p>
    At a Sing, people normally do not dance and instead just focus on the singing.
    Bill does tell of times, though, when particular elder women got so enthusiastic about songs being sung that they stood up and danced in place.
