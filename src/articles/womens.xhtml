    <em class="seneca">Ë:sgä:nye:’</em> or New Women’s Shuffle Dance, a dance for women only, is both the oldest and the newest of Seneca Earth Songs

    In the Haudenosaunee Creation story, Sky Woman falls from the Sky World onto the back of a giant turtle, and after the animals finally figure out how to bring up mud and put it on the turtle’s back;
    as Bill Crouse’s daughter Ashlyn explains, Sky Woman <q>dances in a counterclockwise circle, shuffling her feet to work it in, and the earth grew and grew into what we call North America</q>
    <aac:citation key="CrouseAshlyn:Interview-2023_09" />.
    </p>
    <p>
    When women dance <em class="seneca">Ë:sgä:nye:’</em> today, they are joining in that original circle and renewing the earth.
    For this reason, the dance is called New because unlike for other Earth Songs, tradition allows singers to invent new songs for this dance.
    As we have discussed <a class="internal" href="relationship.html#sec:relationship-sing">elsewhere</a>, singing societies gather at a Sing and present sets of Women’s Dance songs that they exchange, and built up their own repertoire of songs by ancestors, teachers, and friends

    Singers make songs with Seneca words that talk about their own experiences and with tunes that may draw on other contemporary music, as long as it fits the basic beat and structure of the dance.

    <h1>Words and Stories</h1>
    <p>
    People make Ë:sgä:nye:’ about everyday life experiences, elements of the natural world like water or strawberries, traditional teachings, and many other topics.
    Many of the words and melodies came to the makers’ minds all at once, sometimes in dreams, while other songs were more deliberately constructed.
    Many Women’s Dance songs use vocables like other social-dance songs, especially the ending phrase <em class="seneca">gai:nawea:h he:ah</em>.
    But many more songs of this type use Seneca language.
    Some of the lyrics are reminiscent of a haiku: a pithy expression of a specific concept or image in just a few lines.
    Songmakers take full advantage of the capacity of the Seneca language to pack a sentence worth of meaning into a few words.
    For example, in the anonymous older song introduced in our discussion of <a class="internal" href="relationship.html#sec:relationships-songs-overview">Relationship and Reciprocity</a>
    (<aac:ref type="table" href="#tab:womens_dance-sky_world" />), the maker conveys one of the core purposes of Earth Songs with the one word <em class="seneca">deyögwada’nigöëwë:nye:h</em>, literally <q>we are stirring our own minds</q> or perhaps better translated <q>we are occupying our minds</q>.

    In September 2022 members of the Allegany Singers recorded a set of Ë:sgä:nye:’ at the cookhouse next to the Coldspring Longhouse
    <aac:paren><aac:ref type="video" href="#vid:womens-coldspring" /></aac:paren>, and shared about the meaning and stories of the songs
    <aac:paren><aac:ref type="video" href="#vid:womens-coldspring-interview" /></aac:paren>.
    Together they paint a picture of the Allegany Territory as a site of intense creativity over many decades, as singers competed to present the best set of Women’s Dance songs at Sings while learning and preserving each others’ songs.
    They have continued making new songs while still singing ones from their teachers and even older, now anonymous, songs they call <q>Used-to-Be Songs</q>.
    The Allegany community was notable for <q>passing the drum</q> and allowing the younger men to contribute their own songs to the sets, as the Allegany Singers did in the set we recorded, whereas on other territories there tends to be one main singer who makes or selects the songs for the group.

    <p>
    In July 2024 John Block, Seneca singer and language teacher at the Seneca
    Nation’s Faithkeeper School in Steamburg, New York, sang three Ë:sgä:nye:’ for Bill and Andrew and explained their words and the stories behind them
    <aac:paren><aac:ref type="video" href="#vid:womens-block" /></aac:paren>.
    The songs he selected are a song made by Arthur Johnny-John in the 1950s about the looming Kinzua Dam tragedy
    <aac:citation key="Hauptman:Kinzua" pages="xvii–xxi" />, 
    an anonymous older song about <a class="internal" href="songs.html#sec:handsome-lake-intro">Handsome Lake’s</a> prophecies of the end of the world, 
    and a song he himself made for the close of a Sing.
    For John, remembering each song pulled up a wealth of knowledge both about Seneca history, religion, and values.
    Where many Women’s Dance songs are <q>good fun</q> and emphasize enjoying life, the first two songs John chose show a deeper, darker, and more philosophical side.
    The Kinzua Dam Song is a snapshot of a community in crisis, dealing with the trauma before its full force had even hit; the first line says, <q>They are abusing us,</q> or John suggests a better translation might be, <q>They are raping us.</q>
    </p>

      <figCaption>John Block sings and tells the stories of three Ë:sgä:nye:’ songs</figCaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
    The songs John shared also called to mind the people who taught them to him, when they used to sing them, and the stories they told about them.
    Bill told a story about singing an Ë:sgä:nye:’ for his teacher, and asking if he had heard it before, when it turned out that the song had actually been made by his teacher.
    John told a story about someone else singing a song for him that they heard sung at a Sing and were impressed with, and the other person did not know it was actually a song John had made
    <aac:citation key="Block:Interview-2024_07_25" />.
    </p>
    <p>
    The last song John shared also highlighted the creative relationship with <a class="internal" href="tradition.html">tradition</a> that is cultivated in Women’s Dance songs: for a song he designed to be sung at the end of a Sing as a kind of festive recessional, he borrowed a portion of a <a class="internal" href="quiver.html"><em class="seneca">Ga’da:šot</em></a>, the centuries-old marching dance that traditionally starts a social.
    John says that his own preferences have always tended toward the older
    songs and styles, and
    He worries, though, that essential information about the old songs is being
    lost as fewer people know the language.
    He cited a recent experience where a singing group was singing garbled versions of songs that they learned phonetically from recordings without knowing the actual words or their meaning.
    At the same time, he remains hopeful about the future of Seneca music and praises the enthusiasm of the younger generation that is adapting Ë:sgä:nye:’ in its own new ways.
    In this way Women’s Dance remains true to its traditional connection to Sky Woman and the ongoing, circular process of creation.

      <h3>Men and Women in the Women’s Dance</h3>
    <p>
    It may be surprising to outsiders that New Women’s Shuffle Dance songs are primarily made and sung by men.
    Traditional Seneca society before colonization was organized according to a duality but not a hierarchy of gender.
    In other words, men and women had distinct roles, but one was not elevated above the other.
    Yes, the Haudenosaunee Confederacy was governed by male chiefs, but those chiefs derived their authority from the clan mothers who selected them and could depose them at any time, Haudenosaunee communities were both matrilineal (family and clan membership was traced through the mother’s line) and matrilocal (a man moved to live with his wife’s family, not the reverse).
    In the Seneca language, if the speaker is referring to something or someone of unknown gender, they use the female as a default.
    The <q>woods</q> domain of hunting and warfare was reserved for men, and the <q>clearing</q> domain of agriculture and child rearing was reserved for women, but that did not mean that one domain was viewed as superior to the other.
    Likewise women danced Ë:sgä:nye:’; men sang it.
    The key value, as in other aspects of Native societies, was balance.
    </p>
    <p>
    Since colonization, the gender situation is a complicated mix of traditional Haudenosaunee and Euro-American values and practices.
    Traditionalists maintain the gender distinction in social dance, though as an integral part of the tradition, without necessary endorsing traditional gender dualities in other areas of life.
    There are all-female singing societies like the Six Nations Women Singers, as well as prominent Haudenosaunee women singers like Sadie Buck and Joanne Shenandoah.
    There do appear to be transgender dancers at Haudenosaunee powwows and they seem to accepted without controversy.
    </p>
    <p>
    In public presentations for settler audiences, Bill Crouse tells how Smoke Dance developed from men trying to make War Dance into a showy competition dance, and then says that women wanted an opportunity to dance Smoke Dance as well; he often invites the crowd to judge who danced better, the women or the men, and invariably he says the women won.
    In a <a href="https://youtu.be/z8zb_tcCD8M?si=0KdwqQX9uFYldytt">dance presentation of Ë:sgä:nye:’</a> by the Indigenous Spirit Dancers at Caneadea in 2024, leader Marty Jimerson, Jr., introduced the dance by highlighting the importance of women in Haudenosaunee culture:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      In our traditional ways, we hold all our females in high regard.
      Within the longhouses we have the clan mothers, our title holders.
      They are the life givers.
    </blockquote>
    <p class="continue">
    He then connected the dance back to the Creation story and stressed that the women never let their feet leave the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
    I (Andrew) would be remiss not to acknowledge that the voices we are privileging in this study are almost all male (though I have tried to cite as many female authors as possible).
    This is a shortcoming of this study, no way around it.
    Future products that wish to build on this research would do well to seek out more female perspectives than we have included here.

      <h2>Musical Structure (Andrew)</h2>
      <section id="sec:womens-music-structure">
        <p>
        Analyzing many variations of formal patterns, melodic contours and pitch collections, and rhythms of Ë:sgä:nye:’ across the years, would require a separate study, as would understanding the many ways the makers of these songs have incorporated references to other Earth Songs and even non-Seneca music.
        But as we have done with other Earth Songs, we hope that it is helpful as a starting point to include some of Andrew’s analytical observations, while acknowledging their Western-influenced approach.
        Most Women’s Dance songs I (Andrew) has heard use a <q>major</q> diatonic pitch collection.
        Four Ë:sgä:nye:’ recorded by Jake George, Bill Crouse, and the Allegany Singers all used six-note collections, same as the major scale without the leading tone <aac:degree n="7" /> (<aac:ref type="table" href="#tab:womens-sky_world-pitches" />).
        </p>
        <xi:include href="../tables/womens-sky_world-pitches.xhtml" />
        <p>
        In formal pattern, I hear most of these songs starting with a <q>lead</q> phrase, sung by the leader solo, and then repeated by the whole group.
        A contrasting phrase follows, often emphasizing different pitches than the lead phrase.
        This phrase often concludes with an echo of the ending of the lead phrase, making an <em>ab cb</em> or <em>ab cb<aac:prime /></em> pattern.
        </p>
        <p>
        This melodic and phrasing pattern are exemplified in the Ë:sgä:nye:’ made by Herb Dowdy, as sung by Jacob Dowdy at Caneadea 
        <aac:paren>
        <aac:ref type="video" href="#vid:womens-caneadea" />,
        <aac:ref type="music" href="#mus:womens-gayowaneh" />
        </aac:paren>.
        The lead phrase has two parts (labeled <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>), where the first descends from the highest pitch down to the lowest, emphasizing the tones of the major triad (<aac:degree n="8" />, <aac:degree n="5" />, <aac:degree n="3" />, <aac:degree n="1" />), and the second part leaps back up to <aac:degree n="5" /> before settling back down to <aac:degree n="1" /> for the final vocable words <em>gai:naweaheah</em>.
        The first part of the contrast phrase (<em>C</em>) moves up to <aac:degree n="6" /> for the first time in the song, and emphasizes <aac:degree n="6" />, <aac:degree n="4" />, and <aac:degree n="2" /> more than the other phrases.
        (To Western-trained ears like mine, the contrast phrase might sound like it is implying a subdominant harmony.)
        Then the phrase ends by repeating the <em>B</em> subphrase from the lead.
        </p>

        <p>
        Another, possibly older, anonymous song demonstrates the same patterns, though with a distinct, livelier style.
        In the song starting <q>Gëöya’ge:h</q> (In the Sky World) 
        <aac:paren>
        <aac:ref type="video" href="#vid:womens-coldspring" />, song 1;
        <aac:ref type="music" href="#mus:womens-sky_world" />
        </aac:paren>,
        the lead phrase starts at the top of the range and then descends, emphasizing the pitches of the major triad on the way down.
        The first part of the lead phrase (<em>A</em>) ends on <aac:degree n="2" />, then the second part steps down from <aac:degree n="3" /> to <aac:degree n="1" /> and ends with the vocable <em>gai:naweah heah</em> on <aac:degree n="1" />.
        The contrast phrase jumps back up to emphasize <aac:degree n="5" /> (<em>C</em>), and then descends again to a last subphrase (<em>B<aac:prime /></em>) that echoes and extends the end of the lead phrase.
        </p>

        </figure>
        <p>
        Rhythmically this song is highly syncopated.
        I hear a symmetrical pattern in each phrase where on-beat gestures at the beginning and end of the phrase frame more complex syncopated figures in the middle (a <em>chiastic</em> or ring structure).
        In each phrase, on-beat quarter- and eighth-note gestures set up the beat pattern and then give way to more quickly moving syncopated figures.
        Those figures finally resolve again to on-beat gestures with a clear <q>downbeat</q> landing when the melody finally arrives at <aac:degree n="1" />.

      <section id="sec:womens-music-harmony">
        <h3>Harmony</h3>
        <p>
        A remarkable feature of some Ë:sgä:nye:’ is that they feature harmony (polyphony).
        Typically when Seneca singers use the term <em>harmony</em>, they mean women doubling the men’s melody at the octave.
        But in some Women’s Dance songs, there are separate polyphonic lines as well.
        In the <aac:TODO note="transcription and/or score video?">last song</aac:TODO> recorded by the Allegany Singers in 2022
        <aac:paren>
        <aac:ref type="video" href="#vid:womens-coldspring">, starting at 10:40</aac:ref>
        </aac:paren>, one of the old, anonymous <q>Used-To-Be</q> songs, some of the singers start singing a separate harmony part on the contrast phrase.
        This first time through, this line is a drone on <aac:degree n="8" />, above the main melody.
        The second time, the harmony singers move down from <aac:degree n="8" /> to <aac:degree n="7" /> just before the final subphrase, creating a feeling (to my ears) of dominant–tonic harmonic movement at the end.
        </p>
        <p>
        Relative to my own range of musical experience, this drone-based style of harmony reminds me of Euro-American folk traditions like Sacred Harp shape-note singing.
        Aspects of the rhythm and phrasing in this song also bring Stephen Foster songs to my mind.
        That said, there is no reason, given how little research has been done on such questions, to conclude that every element of Seneca music that sounds Western to Western-trained ears has a Western origin; many things in music have been invented independently in multiple cultures and places, and sometimes flows of influence are found to move in the opposite direction than was first thought.
        </p>
        <p>
        I feel more confident in asserting that, analogous to shape-note singing, Seneca Women’s Dance songs were created to be sung loudly at the top of singers’ registers with a kind of natural belting technique that creates abundant overtones, especially in wood-panelled indoor spaces like the longhouse or other resonant spaces like the cookhouse that the Allegany Singers selected for this recording.
        The normal <q>harmony</q> of doubling at the octave, then, has the effect of emphasizing the overtones that are already there, exactly analogous to European <em>organum</em> traditions.
        The harmony voice serves more as an acoustical enrichment of the main voice, like the components of an organ registration, than as a separate contrapuntal line.
        The type of polyphony heard in this Women’s Dance example brightens up the overtone profile even more by droning on <aac:degree n="8" />, which for most of the contrast phrase is a perfect fourth above the melody—again, exactly analogous to some European organum practices.
        I am not saying that this tradition descends from organum (though that may actually be the case for Appalachian shape-note singing), but that both musical traditions are going for a similar effect.

      <h2>Versions</h2>
      <p>
      For other Earth Songs, there is a huge repertoire of songs for each, and individual singers will choose a different selection or ordering of songs.
      But singers are always selecting from the same pool of all the known songs for that particular dance, and that repertoire does not change.
      With New Women’s Shuffle Dance, by contrast, there is no one set of songs that everyone sings.
      Ë:sgä:nye:’ is more like a genre of songs to which singers are expected make new contributions.
      Some of their new songs get picked up and passed along until they become established parts of singing societies’ local repertoires; others exist for a moment and may be forgotten, even by their makers.
      The <a class="internal" href="moccasin.html#vid:moccasin-score">Old Moccasin Dance</a> songs that the Allegany Singers recorded in 2002 were largely the same as those they recorded in 2022; but the Women’s Dance sets they recorded in the same sessions were completely different
      <aac:paren>
      <aac:ref type="video" href="#vid:womens-allegany-older" />
      </aac:paren>, as they were chosen by the specific people involved in each session, expressive of their own interests, history, and present cirucmstances.

      <p>
      That means there are hundreds or thousands of Ë:sgä:nye:’ currently in circulation across Iroquoia, and even more that have been laid aside and are known only from recordings or not at all.
      Hence Bill Crouse had never heard any of the <q>Songs of 1947</q> that Ed Curry sang for William Fenton until we listened to Fenton’s recording in July 2024
      <aac:paren><aac:ref type="video" href="#vid:womens-curry" /></aac:paren>.
      Many Women’s Dance recordings probably survive in cassette tapes gathering dust in the back of Seneca people’s drawers and cabinets: Bill tells how in earlier decades, whenever a singing group would finish their set at a Sing, their voices would be followed by a prolonged click-click-click of everyone pressing Stop on their handheld tape recorders.

      Makers of Ë:sgä:nye:’ have often incorporated elements they heard from the contemporary world, like the songs Bill’s relatives sang for anthropologist William Sturtevant in the 1950s that drew on older white-American popular songs.
      </aac:TODO>
      The influence flowed the other way when the celebrated Oneida/Onondaga musician Joanne Shenandoah adapted Ë:sgä:nye:’ in several of her recordings, most notably the 1996 album <cite>Matriarch: Iroquois Women’s Songs</cite>.
      She opened this album of gentle Ë:sgä:nye:’ remixes with a song made on the Allegany Territory by Bill’s teacher Herb Dowdy
      <aac:paren><aac:ref type="video" href="#vid:shenandoah_matriarch-dowdy" /></aac:paren>.
      The original song is still sung today by the Allegany Singers; Jacob Dowdy chose it for the Women’s Dance presentation at the historic first <a class="internal" href="relationship.html#sec:caneadea">Seneca-Caneadea Field Day</a> in 2023

      Shenandoah brings out the diatonic and triadic elements of the song by arranging it as a European-style round, something with no precedent in traditional Haudenosaunee music but with a result sure to please the ears of listeners more used to Euro-American music.

      <p>
      Indeed, this was the first Haudenosaunee song I (Andrew) ever heard: when I was sixteen and traveling with my family from Indiana to the Navajo Nation in Arizona, I found this track on one of those CD samplers with headphones in a gas station or rest stop, where you could listen to a few minutes of a CD before deciding to buy it.
      I was so taken with it that, while my family attended to the call of nature, I listened to it over and over again until I was able to go back in the car and write it down (and yes, at sixteen I carried staff paper with me for just this sort of emergency).
      Hearing the song again at Caneadea brought me full circle, even more so when Bill told me it had been made by his teacher.

    At a social, Ë:sgä:nye:’ is danced exclusively by women.

    At a Sing, people normally do not dance and instead just focus on the singing.
