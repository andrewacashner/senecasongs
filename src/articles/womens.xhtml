    <em class="seneca">Ë:sgä:nye:’</em> or New Women’s Shuffle Dance, a dance for women only, is both the oldest and the newest of Seneca Earth Songs.
    In the Haudenosaunee Creation story, Sky Woman falls from the Sky World onto the back of a giant turtle, and after the animals finally figure out how to bring up mud and put it on the turtle’s back;
    as Bill Crouse’s daughter Ashlyn explains, Sky Woman <q>dances in a counterclockwise circle, shuffling her feet to work it in, and the earth grew and grew into what we call North America</q>

    </p>
    <p>
    When women dance <em class="seneca">Ë:sgä:nye:’</em> today, they are joining in that original circle and renewing the earth.
    For this reason, the dance is called New because unlike for other Earth Songs, tradition allows singers to invent new songs for this dance.
    Singing societies gather at a Sing and present sets of Women’s Dance songs that they exchange, and built up their own repertoire of songs by ancestors, teachers, and friends.
    Singers make songs with Seneca words that talk about their own experiences and with tunes that may draw on other contemporary music, as long as it fits the basic beat and structure of the dance.
