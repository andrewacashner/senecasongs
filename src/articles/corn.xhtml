    <em class="seneca">Onëö’ oënö</em> or Corn Dance honors one of the most important foods to the Seneca Nation historically, one of the Three Sisters with beans and squash.
    </p>
    <p>
    Corn Dance is somewhat controversial because some Seneca communities including Tonawanda consider it to be a ceremonial dance.
    At <em class="seneca">Ohi:yo’</em> (the Allegany Territory of the Seneca Nation), Corn Dance is considered one a social-dance song that is appropriate for sharing with the public, and this project reflect Bill Crouse’s <em class="seneca">Ohi:yo’</em> perspective.

    <h1>Story</h1>
    <p>
    Bill’s teachers told him that all of the social dances at one time were ceremonial, but over time they lost their ceremonial functions.
    In his view, Corn Dance is just one of the dances to change its function more recently.
    Like other social dances, this one is used in connection with ceremonies but it can also be sung at other times.
    </p>
    <p>
    Whether as part of ceremony or not, Corn Dance has always been connected to the growing of corn (maize), a food first domesticated by indigenous Americans in ancient times, and now a major part of the whole planet’s food supply.
    There is archeological evidence of domesticated maize in Seneca territory as early as ten thousand years ago. <!-- TODO ? -->
    Corn was and is cultivated as one of the Three Sisters, <em class="seneca">Ha’denö:dë:nö:dë’ johehgöh</em> (Our Life Sustainers); the others are beans and squash.
    The three plants grow in such a way that each complements the other.
    </p>
    <p>
    Charred remnants from the inside of clay cooking pots from about two thousand years ago indicate that people in this region were cooking corn in ways that would still be recognizable to Seneca people today.
    Two of the most common traditional ways of preparing corn are <em class="seneca">Onohgwa:’</em> (corn soup) and cornbread. <!-- TODO words -->
    Both recipes start by soaking corn in water with ash, an indigenous invention (called <term>nixtamalization</term> after the Náhuatl term for it) that greatly enhances the nutritional value of corn.
    </p>
    <p>
    Some form of the Corn Dance have probably accompanied these traditions of growing and preparing corn since they were discovered so many centuries ago.
    There is archeological evidence of Haudenosaunee instruments and ceremonial tools (including turtle-shell rattles) from two thousand years ago, suggesting long continuity and interrelationship among these practices.

      <h2>Musical Structure (Andrew)</h2>
      <p>
      In this section I (Andrew) present my own analysis of the Corn Dance songs, as I hear them, acknowledging that this is only my perspective, not part of the oral tradition, and undoubtedly shaped by my own Eurocentric training.
      </p>
      <p>
      As with other social dances, the songs for Corn Dance bear a strong family resemblance to each other even though they contrast in many ways.
      Every live and recorded performance that I have heard includes the same first two songs (or to label it another way, the same introduction and first song).
      That is notable because all the other songs seem to be related to one or the other of those first two songs.
      </p>
      <p>
      The opening song, or introduction, is in free tempo (no steady beat).
      The lead singer starts with the first phrase (<em>Eyo:h ha:dine:h</em>) and then the other singers join in unison for the continuation.
      Their melody follows a descending outline.
      In the 2002 Allegany Singers recording with Kyle Dowdy singing lead, Kyle begins on approximately <aac:pitch pname="C" oct="4" />.
      The phrases move down from C to B<aac:fl /> and B<aac:fl /> to A<aac:fl />, outlining a stepwise major third.
      Then the last phrase jumps down to F, dips down to low C, and back up to end on F (outlining a perfect fifth), before the concluding <em>Yo:ho:h</em> on C.
      If this were a Gregorian chant I would say it had a reciting tone of C and an F final.
      It outlines the pitch collection <aac:pcset n="0 3 5 7" />, which for convenience I will call <q>minor</q> because the bottom third (F–A<aac:fl />) is a minor (smaller) third.
      </p>
      <p>
      After this slow, solemn, minor-sounding introduction in unison, the next song contrasts in every way: there is now a steady beat supported by the horn rattles; the melody is now a call-and-response between leader and the other singers, and the melody now outlines a major-sounding collection, <aac:pcset n="0 2 4 7" />.
      Though as usual Seneca singers do not have to maintain a steady pitch level, in most versions the final stays the same, so the effect is of shifting from minor to major keys.
      The mood shifts with the change of scales, becoming lighter, more energetic, and more march-like.
      <!-- ?? -->
      In phrase structure, there is now a first pair of phrases, repeated, ending on the F final; followed by a contrasting middle phrase on G (<aac:degree n="2" />), and then multiple repeats of the first pair of phrases.
      Despite these differences, there are commonalities with the introductory song: the melody still traces a descending major third at the beginning and a perfect fifth, dipping down to low C, at the end.
      </p>
      <p>
      All the other songs in Kyle Dowdy’s recording can be grouped as being more similar to one of these two songs, distinguished by having a base of either a <q>minor</q> (<aac:pcset n="0 3 5 7" />) collection, or <q>major</q> (<aac:pcset n="0 2 4 7" />), with other pitches added in some songs
      (<aac:ref type="table" href="tab:corn-pitches" />).
      Song 11 is the only one that mixes major and minor collections, including both A<aac:fl /> and A<aac:na />.
