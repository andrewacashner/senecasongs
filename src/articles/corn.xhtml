    <em class="seneca">Onëö’ oënö</em> or Corn Dance honors one of the most important foods to the Seneca Nation historically, one of the Three Sisters with beans and squash

    <p>
    Corn Dance is somewhat controversial because some Seneca communities including Tonawanda consider it to be a ceremonial dance.
    At <em class="seneca">Ohi:yo’</em> (the Allegany Territory of the Seneca Nation), Corn Dance is considered one a social-dance song that is appropriate for sharing with the public, and this project reflect Bill Crouse’s <em class="seneca">Ohi:yo’</em> perspective.

    <h1>Story</h1>
    <p>
    Bill’s teachers told him that all of the social dances at one time were ceremonial, but over time they lost their ceremonial functions.
    In his view, Corn Dance is just one of the dances to change its function more recently.
    Like other social dances, this one is used in connection with ceremonies but it can also be sung at other times.
    </p>
    <p>
    Whether as part of ceremony or not, Corn Dance has always been connected to the growing of corn (maize), a food first domesticated by indigenous Americans in ancient times, and now a major part of the whole planet’s food supply.
    There is archeological evidence of domesticated maize in Seneca territory as early as ten thousand years ago. <!-- TODO ? -->
    Corn was and is cultivated as one of the Three Sisters, <em class="seneca">Ha’denö:dë:nö:dë’ johehgöh</em> (Our Life Sustainers); the others are beans and squash.
    The three plants grow in such a way that each complements the other.
    </p>
    <p>
    Charred remnants from the inside of clay cooking pots from about two thousand years ago indicate that people in this region were cooking corn in ways that would still be recognizable to Seneca people today.
    Two of the most common traditional ways of preparing corn are <em class="seneca">Onohgwa:’</em> (corn soup) and cornbread. <!-- TODO words -->
    Both recipes start by soaking corn in water with ash, an indigenous invention (called <term>nixtamalization</term> after the Náhuatl term for it) that greatly enhances the nutritional value of corn.
    </p>
    <p>
    Some form of the Corn Dance have probably accompanied these traditions of growing and preparing corn since they were discovered so many centuries ago.
    There is archeological evidence of Haudenosaunee instruments and ceremonial tools (including turtle-shell rattles) from two thousand years ago, suggesting long continuity and interrelationship among these practices.

      <h2>Words</h2>
      <p>
      As with other Earth Songs, the words of Corn Dance are vocables with no linguistic meaning
      <aac:paren><aac:ref type="table" href="#tab:corn-dowdy-words" /></aac:paren>.
      Most of the songs include a version of the antiphonal response <em>hai:wihah</em>.
      Songs with similar vocables are usually similar in other ways, as in the several songs that include <em>weniyo:h</em>, <em>wenuya:h</em>, and <em>weganawiyo:h</em>.
      A few recurring vocables sound like Seneca words—<em>wiyo:h</em> (it’s good), <em>ne:wa’</em> (turn, as in <q>your turn</q>), <em>onë:h</em> (now)—but this is probably just coincidence.

      <h2>Musical Structure (Andrew)</h2>
      <p>
      In this section I (Andrew) present my own analysis of the Corn Dance songs, as I hear them, acknowledging that this is only my perspective, not part of the oral tradition, and undoubtedly shaped by my own Eurocentric training.
      </p>
      <p>
      As with other social dances, the songs for Corn Dance bear a strong family resemblance to each other even though they contrast in many ways.
      Every live and recorded performance that I have heard includes the same first two songs (or to label it another way, the same introduction and first song).
      That is notable because all the other songs seem to be related to one or the other of those first two songs.
      </p>
      <section id="sec:overview">
        <h3>Songs 1–2 as Model for the Others</h3>
        <p>
        The opening song, or introduction, is in free tempo (no steady beat).
        The lead singer starts with the first phrase (<em>Eyo:h ha:dine:h</em>) and then the other singers join in unison for the continuation.
        Their melody follows a descending outline.
        In the 2002 Allegany Singers recording with Kyle Dowdy singing lead, Kyle begins on approximately <aac:pitch pname="C" oct="4" />.
        The phrases move down from C to B<aac:fl /> and B<aac:fl /> to A<aac:fl />, outlining a stepwise major third.
        Then the last phrase jumps down to F, dips down to low C, and back up to end on F (outlining a perfect fifth), before the concluding <em>Yo:ho:h</em> on C.
        If this were a Gregorian chant I would say it had a reciting tone of C and an F final.
        It outlines the pitch collection <aac:pcset n="0 3 5 7" />, which for convenience I will call <q>minor</q> because the bottom third (F–A<aac:fl />) is a minor (smaller) third.
        </p>
        <p>
        After this slow, solemn, minor-sounding introduction in unison, the next song contrasts in every way: there is now a steady beat supported by the horn rattles; the melody is now a call-and-response between leader and the other singers, and the melody now outlines a major-sounding collection, <aac:pcset n="0 2 4 7" />.
        Though as usual Seneca singers do not have to maintain a steady pitch level, in most versions the final stays the same, so the effect is of shifting from minor to major keys.
        The mood shifts with the change of scales, becoming lighter, more energetic, and more march-like.
        <!-- ?? -->
        In phrase structure, there is now a first pair of phrases, repeated, ending on the F final; followed by a contrasting middle phrase on G (<aac:degree n="2" />), and then multiple repeats of the first pair of phrases.
        Despite these differences, there are commonalities with the introductory song: the melody still traces a descending major third at the beginning and a perfect fifth, dipping down to low C, at the end.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="sec:pitches">
        <h3>Pitch Collections</h3>
        <p>
        All the other songs in Kyle Dowdy’s recording can be grouped as being more similar to one of these two songs, distinguished by having a base of either a <q>minor</q> (<aac:pcset n="0 3 5 7" />) collection, or <q>major</q> (<aac:pcset n="0 2 4 7" />), with other pitches added in some songs
        <aac:paren><aac:ref type="table" href="#tab:corn-pitches" /></aac:paren>.
        Song 11 is the only one that mixes major and minor collections, including both A<aac:fl /> and A<aac:na />.
        </p>
        <xi:include href="../tables/corn-pitches.xhtml" />
        <xi:include href="../tables/corn-pitches-grouped.xhtml" />
        <p>
        These songs are distinguished by using a limited number of pitches.
        Eight of the seventeen songs have only four pitches; five are pentatonic.
        Only four songs have more than five pitches, and of those, only song 11—the one that mixes major and minor—has seven pitches.
        Though the songs based on the <pcset n="0 2 4 7" /> collection sound minor, no songs in this set include <aac:degree accid="fl" n="6" />.
        This is a higher proportion of songs with five or fewer pitches than in <em class="seneca">Gayo:waga:yöh</em> (Old Moccasin Dance, mostly six-tone), and much higher than the mostly diatonic <em class="seneca">Ë:sgä:nye:’</em> (New Women’s Shuffle Dance) songs.
        Among dances I’ve studied so far, only <em class="seneca">Jö:yaik oënö’</em> (Robin Dance) has more songs with five or fewer pitches (out of six Robin Dance songs on the recordeding studied, four have four tones and 2 have five).
        There is more variation in the <em class="seneca">Ga’da:šo:t</em> (Standing Quiver Dance) songs, which include a similar alternation between major- and minor-sounding collections.
        The set of pitches used in an Earth Song forms part of the <q>palette</q> distinctive to that dance and is one element that creates the sense of family relationships within the songs.
        Comparison of pitch collections may be one data point that could eventually be used to establish relative dates of the Earth Songs—could those with fewer pitches perhaps be older?—though vastly more research is needed.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="sec:phrases">
        <h3>Phrases and Formal Structure</h3>
        <p>
        Similar to Old Moccasin Dance, the songs for Corn Dance can be grouped into only a few types of phrase structures.
        I hear three phrases in the opening song, where the last two phrases have the same ending: <em>a bc dc</em>.
        The largest group of phrase structures we can identify follows this three-phrase pattern and includes nine songs.
        The next group follows the pattern of song 2 (the first <q>major</q> song, with call-and-response).
        Three songs in this group have three sections with repeated first and third sections, for example <em>aaaa b aaaa</em> or <em>ab ab ab c ab ab ab</em>.
        The last group of phrase structures, including four songs, has four phrases in two parallel groups, where the even-numbered subphrases end the same way, for example <em>ab cd, cb cd</em> or <em>a b c b<aac:prime /></em>.
        </p>
        <p>
        While pitch collections do not correlate with these groups—there are <q>minor</q> and <q>major</q> songs in both three- and four-phrase groups—songs within one of these three phrasing groups do follow similar melodic outlines.
        The three-phrase songs follow the basic descending pattern of the opening song: 
        <aac:degree n="5" />–<aac:degree n="4" />–<aac:degree n="3" />–<aac:degree n="1" />(–low <aac:degree n="5" />–<aac:degree n="1" />).
        Notably both <q>minor</q> and <q>major</q> songs with this phrasing follow that same descending outline.
        The four-phrase songs, all <q>minor</q>, also outline the same descent but their parallel phrase structure requires them to repeat the last part of it:
        <aac:degree n="5" />–<aac:degree n="4" />–<aac:degree n="3" />–<aac:degree n="1" />–<aac:degree n="3" />–<aac:degree n="1" />(–low <aac:degree n="5" />–<aac:degree n="1" />).
        One could certainly hear these four-phrase songs as just the same pattern as the three-phrase songs, extended by repeating the final phrase.
        The other group, the three-section call-and-response songs, use a different outline, stressing <aac:degree n="1" /> in the first and last sections, and a contrasting <aac:degree n="2" /> in the middle section.
        </p>

      </section>
      <section id="sec:corn-music-antiphonal">
        <h3>Call and Response</h3>
        <p>
        As in the Standing Quiver Dance (and unlike many other Earth Songs), several of the songs in Corn Dance are antiphonal: that is, they feature a call-and-response texture.
        The string of <q>major</q> songs in Dowdy’s set, songs 2–5 all feature short call-and-response phrases with the response <em>hai:wihah</em>.
        In Dowdy’s version, the following songs are all unison except song 7, until the final song closes with an antiphonal section (<em>wigoh</em>/<em>aheh</em>).
        </p>
        <p>
        Are there traces, though, of antiphonal texture in the other songs?
        Several of the <q>unison</q> songs feature repetitive phrases and response-like phrases that suggest these songs might once have been sung antiphonally, or that they descend from earlier antiphonal versions.
        Dowdy’s songs 6 and 7 are intriguing in this respect: they contain the same melodic and rhythmic material, but song 6 is unison and song 7 is call-and-response.
        In song 7, the melody that was used in song 6 is now broken up into phrases sung by the lead singer, to which the others respond <em>hai:eh ya:hah</em> in quarter notes (one-beat notes) on F (the final).
        That response was already present in song 6 but there it was part of the unison melody.
        <!-- example -->
        Other songs include the same kind of perhaps-vestigial response phrase: song 12 (<em>hai:eh ga:ha-ah</em>), 13 (same as previous), 14 (<em>ya:ha-ah</em>), and 15 (<em>hai:eh ga:ha-ah</em>).
        Could these songs once have been antiphonal, or are there antiphonal versions of them?
        </p>
        <p>
        Similarly, in the later Allegany Singers recording (2022) with Jake George singing lead, the group sings a variant that is identical in every way to Dowdy’s song 9, except antiphonal instead of unison.
        In the later version, all the repeated phrases are sung as call and response, where Dowdy had the groups sing both call and response together.
        <!-- example -->
        </p>
        <p>
        Of course, when Jesse Cornplanter recorded Corn Dance songs by himself in 1948 and 1954, out of necessity he sang both call and response in all his antiphonal songs.
        Did recordings like that perhaps contribute to some confusion about which songs were antiphonal, or about which parts of those songs were the call and which the response?
        Or was there a common practice of treating the antiphonal parts as optional?

      </section>
      <section id="sec:corn-music-conclusions">
        <h3>Conclusions and Questions</h3>
        <p>
        Considering all of these analytical observations together, I would propose, first, that the basic outlines of the first two songs form the basis of all the others.
        Most of the call-and-response songs follow song 2 in collection, phrasing, melodic outline, and style.
        Most of the unison songs follow song 1 in phrasing and melodic outline, though some match the outline of song 1 with the collection of song 2.
        In two cases, there are highly similar songs in both the three- and four-phrase groups:
        song 7 (three phrases) repeats the same melodic and rhythmic material as song 6 (four phrases), but with a different phrase structure.
        Similarly song 17 (three phrases) is closely similar to song 15 (four phrases).
        That the same musical ideas can be used to make a song of both phrase types gives strength to the idea that this distinction of phrase types is important, and may help clarify how those types work.
        In an analogous fashion, sometimes the existence of a hybrid clarifies a principle of contrast elsewhere, as in song 11 that includes both <q>major</q> and <q>minor</q> elements within the same song.
        Likewise, the final song begins like a three-phrase song in unison but then ends with a repeated antiphonal section that recalls song 2, reinforcing the contrast between unison and call-and-response textures.
        </p>
        <xi:include href="../tables/corn-phrases.xhtml" />
        <p>
        These conclusions raise several questions that I hope to answer with further research:
        <ul>
          <li>Is there a principle of contrast at work here, between minor and major collections, three- and four-phrase structures, antiphonal and unison textures?</li>
          <li>Is that principle related to other aspects of Corn Dance, for example the way its choreography involves frequent changes of direction as though sowing seeds?</li>
          <li>Is there a difference between dances that include songs with a family resemblance and dances where all the songs are essentially variants of the same tune, as in Robin Dance, and perhaps with the Corn Dance songs that seem to be modeled on song 1?</li>
          <li>Despite the major/minor (<aac:degree accid="fl" n="3" />/<aac:degree accid="na" n="3" />) contrast between songs, is the real common thread the descending stepwise major third (C–B<aac:fl />–A<aac:fl /> or A–G–F)? Or is this negated by the fact that song 11 features both minor and major <aac:degree n="3" />?</li>
          <li>Most intriguingly, is the prevalence of limited-collection, 4-pitch songs an indication of age or longevity?
            Could this or any other musical feature be used to establish relative dates of this and other songs?</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
        The second major conclusion I would draw is to speculate that Corn Dance was originally all antiphonal.
        Even most of the unison songs contain elements that sound like responses, or feature repetitive phrase endings that may derive from responses.
        <ul>
          <li>Is the antiphonal character why this and Standing Quiver, which is also (mostly) antiphonal, are the only dances in which the singers must move in the line with the dancers rather that staying stationary off to one side. </li>
          <li>Is the antiphonal texture part of the principle of contrast or alternation discussed above?</li>
          <li>Is it connected to the idea of the community going out into the fields, similar to Standing Quiver with its concept of going on a journey?</li>
          <li>Are there vestigial or embedded responses in other Earth Songs that are now sung as unison?</li>
          <li>Do the antiphonal vs. unison shifts related to Corn Dance’s shifting status as a ceremonial vs. social song, and the differing phases of its use in Three Sisters ceremonies? (And why did the people stop using Corn Dance for ceremony?)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Jake George and the Allegany Singers, 2022</h3>
        <p>
        In September 2023 the Allegany Singers recorded a set of Corn Dance songs for this project in the cookhouse of the Steamburg Community Center on <em class="seneca">Ohi:yo’</em>, next to Coldspring Longhouse
        <aac:paren><aac:ref type="video" href="#vid:corn-coldspring" /></aac:paren>.
        Jake George sang lead.
        The set was very close to that recorded by the same group 21 years earlier with Kyle Dowdy singing lead.
        Jake led the group in Dowdy’s song 1, 2, 5, 13, and a variant of 9.
        Suited to his higher voice, Jake chose a pitch level one step higher (<q>final</q> on G instead of Dowdy’s F).
        His tempos were much slower, at about 60 beats per minute instead of Dowdy’s 78.
        Otherwise the songs were almost identical, with song 2 differing by only a single pitch, and one different vocable in song 5 (<em>Hai</em> for the first syllable instead of <em>We</em>) and in song 13 (<em>weayo:</em> instead of <em>weniyo</em>).
        </p>
        <p>
        After the <q>minor</q> opening, Jake selected only <q>major</q> songs.
        Jake also selected only songs in a call-and-response texture.
        For this recording the group sang a variant antiphonal version of Dowdy’s song 9, whereas Dowdy’s version was in unison.
        The repeated phrases in this song make more sense as calls and responses.

        <p>
        Three recordings of Jesse Cornplanters singing Corn Dance songs survive in the American Philosophical Society as part of William Fenton’s papers.
        They were recorded at the Tonawanda Reservation, on August 26, 1948, and March 23, 1954.
        (The earlier one specifies it was recorded at Cornplanter’s house.)
        A third recording is probably from the same 1954 session.
        <!--

        -->
        Cornplanter introduces the 1948 recording as the Seneca Corn Dance, <q>Newtown version</q>.
        That recording also includes an interview with William Fenton and Gertrude Kurath.
        </p>
        <p>
        Cornplanter sings ten songs on the 1948 recording, comparing to the 2002 Dowdy reference version

        Cornplanter’s final is around F<aac:sh />, and the basic tempo is 92 beats per minute.
        In the longer 1954 recording Cornplanter sings nine songs
        Cornplanter’s final is around E, and the basic tempo is 90 beats per minute.
        The shorter 1954 recording, a fragment, includes two songs: Dowdy song 12, and then Dowdy song 13 and 2 combined.
