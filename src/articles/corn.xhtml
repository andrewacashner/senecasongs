    <em class="seneca">Onëö’ oënö</em> or Corn Dance honors a food that both historically was one of the most important foods of the Seneca Nation.
    <aac:paren><aac:ref type="video" href="#vid:corn-coldspring" /></aac:paren>.
    Corn, or maize (<em>Zea mays</em>), is indigenous to America because it was first domesticated by Native Americans in central Mexico.
    Seneca people, like many other indigenous nations of the Americas, traditionally cultivated corn together with beans and squash, and call these three crops the Three Sisters.
    In Seneca they are called <em class="seneca">Ha’denö:dë:nö:dë’ johehgöh</em> (the sisters, our Life Sustainers).
    Seneca people thank the Three Sisters specifically in the <em class="seneca">Gano:nyök</em>, and this dance connects to that practice of gratitude for the domesticated plants that provide people with food.
    We could group Corn Dance with other food-centered Earth Songs, including Shake the Bush (for beans) and Pigeon Dance (originally for passenger pigeons, which were used as food).

    Corn Dance is a social dance at <em>Ohi:yo’</em> (the Allegany Territory of the Seneca Nation), though it is used in seasonal ceremonies for the Three Sisters on other territories.
    Since this project is based on Bill Crouse’s practice at Allegany, we share it here and ask the understanding of those who have a different local protocol.
    </p>
    <p>
    This social dance demonstrates the deep and ancient relationship Haudenosaunee people have with corn.
    Given the dance’s historic connection with corn agriculture, some form of Corn Dance has likely been cultivated in this land for as long as there has been corn here, which archaeologists estimate to at least two thousand years.

    <h1>Story</h1>

      <p>
      Corn Dance extends gratitude and recognition to corn as one of the Three Sisters along with beans and squash, who are the Life Sustainers of the Haudenosaunee people.
      In the Haudenosaunee Creation story, corn was a gift from Sky Woman to her children at the beginning of human life.
      Traditional stories describe the three plants in the forms of human sisters, each of whom offers something unique to help humans, as in this story told by a Mohawk elder:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        Once upon a time very long ago, there were three sisters who lived together in a field. 
        These sisters were quite different from one another in their size and also in their way of dressing. 
        One of the three was a little sister, so young that she could only crawl at first and she was dressed in green. 
        The second of the three wore a frock of bright yellow and she had a way of running off by herself when the sun shone and the soft wind blew in her face. 
        The third was the eldest sister, standing always very straight and tall above the other sisters and trying to guard them. 
        She wore a pale green shawl, and she had long yellow hair that tossed about her head in the breezes.
        There was only one way in which the three sisters were alike. They loved one another very dearly, and they were never separated
        <aac:citation key="Ganondagan:ThreeSisters" />.
      </blockquote>
      <p>
      In the mid-nineteenth century, Lewis Henry Morgan described Seneca teachings on corn in almost identical language, explaining the idea of inseparable sisters:
      <q>This last belief is illustrated by the natural adaptation of the plants themselves to grow up together in the same field, and perhaps from the same hill</q>
      <aac:citation key="Morgan:League" pages="161" />.
      What Morgan does not acknowledge is that the Three Sisters gardens of the Haudenosaunee were no <q>natural</q> occurence or accident, but were instead an ingenious invention of ancient Americans that they developed in a dynamic relationship with these plants.

      <h2>Corn, the Three Sisters, and Indigenous Ingenuity</h2>
      <p>
      Indigenous people in what is now central Mexico domesticated corn about six thousand years ago
      <aac:citation key="AtlasNAmericanIndian" pages="30" />, and archaeological evidence shows that people began growing corn in today’s Seneca territory as early as 100 CE, with widespread cultivation by 900 CE
      <aac:citationList>
      <aac:citation key="ArchaeologyIroquois" pages="91" />
      <aac:citation key="HartLovis:MaizeHistories" />
      </aac:citationList>.
      All of the Six Nations’ languages share cognate words for corn with the same root as the Seneca <em class="seneca">onëö’</em>, which suggests that the languages diverged from Cherokee and others in the Iroquoian family after the first introduction of corn
      <aac:citation key="Schillaci:IroquoianLinguisticClues" />.
      <q>The development of more frost-resistant strains of corn, and the full use of the great trio of native plants—corn, beans, and squash—increased storable food resources</q> and contributed greatly to the flourishing of Native communities
      <aac:citation key="SettlingNAmerica" pages="24, 26"/>.
      Charred remnants from the inside of clay cooking pots from about two thousand years ago indicate that people in this region were cooking corn in ways that would still be recognizable to Seneca people today

      Two of the most common traditional ways of preparing corn are <em class="seneca">onò:hgwa’</em> (corn soup, <aac:ref type="video" href="#vid:corn-soup" />) and <em class="seneca">gá:hdok</em> (cornbread).
      Both recipes start by soaking parched corn in water with ash, an indigenous invention (called <em>nixtamalization</em> after the Náhuatl term for it) that greatly enhances the nutritional value of corn, as Sioux chef Sean Sherman explains
      <aac:citation key="Sherman:SiouxChef" pages="47–49" />.
      Within the traditional Seneca community, most of the dishes used in ceremonies are corn-based.
      Non-native people can find corn soup at powwows and public cultural festivals on Haudenosaunee territory.

      According to the Potawottami biologist and ecologist Robin Wall Kimmerer,
      corn, beans, and squash grow in such a way that each complements the
      other: the corn grows straight and tall, providing a pole for the vining beans to climb, while the squash spreads out along the base, protecting the plants from weeds and insects
      <aac:citation key="Kimmerer:Sweetgrass" pages="128–140" />.
      The beans provide nitrogen that the other plants need.
      When eaten together, each food balances out what the others lack to provide complete nutrition for humans.

      <h2>Corn, Colonization, and Resistance</h2>
      <p>
      The Euro-American colonizers also understood that corn was a <q>life sustainer</q> of the Haudenosaunee; that is why they repeatedly targeted their corn supplies and fields.
      In 1687 the French Marquis Denonville, in the expedition that destroyed the city at Ganondagan, reported that while they were at <q>the four Seneca villages <aac:dots /> All that time we spent in destroying the corn, which in such great abundance, that the loss, including old corn which was in <em>cache</em> which we burnt, and that which was standing, was computed according to the estimate afterwards made, at four hundred thousand minots [1.2 million bushels] of Indian corn</q>
      <aac:citation pre="quoted in" key="Morgan:League" pages="199" />.
      In the midst of the US Revolutionary War in 1779, General George Washington ordered Major General John Sullivan to tear through Seneca country effecting <q>total destruction and devastation of their settlements</q>, writing,
      <q>It will be essential to ruin their crops now in the ground and prevent their planting more</q>
      <aac:citationList>
      <aac:citation key="Washington:SullivanCampaign" />
      <aac:citation key="NPS:ClintonSullivan" />
      </aac:citationList>.
      </p>
      <p>
      Lewis Henry Morgan, writing in Rochester at the height of the grain-export boom that made that city the <q>Flour City</q>, described corn as <q>one of the gifts of the Indian to the world</q> and recognized that the security of <q>our entire race</q> (the white race, he meant) could depend on the corn supplies grown on ancestral Indian land
      <aac:citation key="Morgan:League" pages="370–374" />.
      Morgan believed that Haudenosaunee people would have to lose their traditions in order to survive in <q>civilization</q>, but the survival of Corn Dance in living oral tradition shows how wrong Morgan was.
      Whenever it is sung and danced, Corn Dance testifies that Seneca people like Bill have not forgotten their ancient relationship with corn or their connection to their ancestral lands.
      For settlers on Seneca territory like Andrew, Corn Dance can remind them that so much of their food is an indigenous product, just as most of the corn fields of western New York are on land guaranteed to the Seneca Nation by the 1794 Treaty of Candandaigua, which was never legally revoked or superseded.
      </p>
      <p>
      Visionary Seneca leader John Mohawk founded the Iroquois White Corn Project specifically to oppose colonial legacies and foster indigenous sovereignty over food and land.
      The project, which continues today at Ganondagan State Historic Site, works <q>to restore the farming, consumption, and distribution of traditional White Corn to Native American communities and to offer White Corn products to the community at large,</q> using <q>heirloom seeds dating back at least 1,400 years in Haudenosaunee communities</q>
      <aac:citation key="Ganondagan:WhiteCorn" />.
      The project aims to restore indigenous ways of growing and processing this indigenous food, and traditional songs and ceremonies are a key part of that effort.

    <section id="sec-corn-dance-significance">
      <h2>No Corn without Corn Dances</h2>
      <p>
      From a Western perspective it might seem that songs and dances are merely folkloric, tangential to the science and business of food production, but from a traditional Haudenosaunee outlook, agriculture and culture are closely intertwined.
      Dances like Corn Dance are not just <q>about</q> corn, but are an integral part of how the community relates to and maintains their food sources, and traditionally were actually part of the planting and harvesting processes.
      In fact, according to Seneca oral tradition, we would not have corn without dances for the corn.
      </p>
      <p>
      As Bill Crouse tells the story, when the late-eighteenth-century prophet Handsome Lake was walking between the ripe corn in late summer, he heard the Corn Spirit speaking to him in the whispering of the leaves.
      The people had lost track of the Creator’s Original Instructions, she told him, and were living in disorder; so she had decided to leave the
      land.
      The prophet begged her to stay and asked what the people needed to do to repair their relationship.
      She told him to have the people sing a specific set of songs dedicated to her in a ceremony for the Three Sisters several times a year.
      These songs, which are still sung at <em class="seneca">Ohi:yo’</em> today, go through the whole agricultural life cycle of corn from planting to harvest.
      </p>
      <p>
      Corn Dance is a separate social dance that is not used in ceremonies on the Allegany Territory, though it is used ceremonially elsewhere.
      Even though the Handsome Lake story is not specifically about the social Corn Dance we are discussing here, it shows that dance and song were integral to the domestication and growing of corn.
      The people needed songs and ceremonies to revive the agricultural practices.
      Similar to <a href="robin.html">Robin Dance</a>, the non-human being gives these songs to the people as a way for them to maintain a proper reciprocal relationship with them.
      </p>
      <p>
      The traditional teachings reminded people that should they neglect their relationships with the life-sustaining plants, they could lose them, as Robin Wall Kimmerer says about a similar story that recurs across Native North America:
      <q>One of our responsibilities as human people is to find ways to enter into reciprocity with the more-than-human world.
        We can do it through gratitude, through ceremony, through land stewardship, science, art, and in everyday acts of practical reverence</q>
      <aac:citation key="Kimmerer:Sweetgrass" pages="190" />.
      Corn Dance, whether done as part of these Three Sisters ceremonies or as a social dance, provides a way for people to orient themselves in a good way in relationships to the corn, a way rooted in gratitude and responsibility.

    <section id="sec:corn-ceremonial">
      <h2>Ceremonial vs. Social Use</h2>
      <p>
      On the Allegany territory of the Seneca Nation, Corn Dance is a social dance and therefore appropriate for sharing with the public.
      On other Seneca territories, Corn Dance is considered a ceremonial dance, but this project reflects the local traditions at Allegany as practiced by Bill Crouse.
      </p>
      <p>
      In the 1940s, Jesse Cornplanter, told anthropologist William Fenton and dance ethnographer Gertrude Kurath that Corn Dance was changing from social to ceremonial use at Newtown Longhouse on the Cattaraugus Territory and on the Tonawanda Territory.

        According to the old custom, it used to be, in the time when they had the ceremonies dedicated to the Three Sisters, the  main support of our lives, what we call <em class="seneca">Johehgöh</em>, that was the time they used to dance this dance. But now, since we lost the old customs and the ways of doing things like the old-timers did, we use them now as a social dance in all occasions.

        <span class="speaker">CORNPLANTER: </span>
        It is now. It was introduced, just recently, and for quite a long time they used that dance instead of that Hand in Hand Dance, because this Corn Dance, according to one of the old chiefs, thought it was dedicated to the Corn, one of the sisters that composed the Three Sisters, our main support of life. <aac:dots />
        Now it’s used as a social dance.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
      Bill’s teachers told him that all of the social dances at one time were ceremonial, but over time they lost their ceremonial functions.
      In his view, Corn Dance is just one of the dances to change its function more recently.
      It would certainly be interesting to scholars to know whether Corn Dance was originally ceremonial, why it stopped being used that way, and why in some places it was restored but not others.
      But we must also respect Seneca faithkeepers’ restrictions on discussing ceremonial outside the Seneca community and leave such questions for those who can bear the proper responsibility for that knowledge.
      Additionally, the details of varying practice between the different territories are fascinating but outside the scope of this project, which focuses on <em class="seneca">Ohi:yo’</em>.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="sec:corn-age">
      <h2>How Old is Corn Dance?</h2>
      <p>
      Corn has been cultivated in Seneca territory for around two thousand years.
      Could Corn Dance be that old?
      Corn was one of the cultural practices that the Haudenosaunee nations had in common before Peacemaker visited them, one of the kindred cultural practices like building longhouses that enabled him to form the league to begin with.
      Those practices have probably always included some kinds of songs and dances offered in reciprocal relationship with these plant beings.
      Certainly since the time of Handsome Lake, circa 1790, there have been some kind of songs and dances connected to corn growing, and that story suggests that there were much more ancient practices that were actually falling into disuse and needed to be restored.
      </p>
      <p>
      Jesse Cornplanter, asked by Fenton how he learned the Corn Dance songs, replied, <q>According to my memory, from what I heard, it has always been used amongst us Seneca longhouses, ages, ages back, handed down from one singer to another.
        And the way I sing is just the way I was taught</q>
      (<aac:ref type="video" href="TODO" />).
      Without recordings or notated music from before the twentieth century we cannot answer whether or how much these songs may have changed over time in their musical details.
      One source of evidence for the longevity of music, dance, and ceremonial practices are the archaeological remains of turtle-shell rattles in Haudenosaunee sites from one thousand years ago, when corn cultivation was becoming widespread
      <aac:citationList>
      <aac:citation key="Pearce:Turtles" />
      <aac:citation key="Sturtevant:IroquoisInstruments" />
      </aac:citationList>.
      (Turtle-shell rattles have been found elsewhere in North America from as early as ten thousand years ago, from the very earliest period of human settlement on the continent; 
      <aac:citation type="plain" key="GillreathBrown:TurtleRattles" />).
      Descriptions of turtle-shell and horn rattles appear in the earliest European descriptions of Iroquoian peoples, such as the Jesuit Lafitau’s 1724 account
      <aac:citation key="Lafitau:Moeurs" pages="215" />.
      </p>
      <p>
      Whether the tunes of Corn Dance songs have changed over the years or not, their social function and meaning remained consistent across centuries.
      It seems reasonable to conclude, then, that there has been some kind of Corn Dance heard on the fertile fields of the Genesee Valley and across Seneca territory for as long as corn has been planted there.
      Long before settlers sang of the <q>amber waves of grain</q> as a central symbol of their country, before corn became a staple for the whole planet, Seneca people and their ancestors were singing some form of Corn Dance on their territory.
      That dance is not just as a sentimental celebration of corn; it is an active way of maintaining a mutually sustaining relationship with the plants that sustain human life.

  <section id="sec:corn-movements">
    <h1>Movements</h1>
    <p>
    As in <a href="quiver.html">Standing Quiver Dance</a>, the singers head up the line of dancers rather than standing off to the side.
    The dancers can move in the typical counterclockwise circle, but at times they follow a back-and-forth pattern until by the end of the dance everyone ends up in a kind of knot at the center of the dance circle.
    Seneca singer Al George says he was taught to think of the corn as being in the center of the circle as the dance was addressed to the corn

    It seems notable to Andrew that Corn Dance is the only Earth Song that is danced in this pattern.
    Andrew speculates that the distinctive sinuous shape may have been inspired by corn in some way, perhaps related to practices of planting and harvesting corn.
    Perhaps a study of the widespread corn-related images in Haudenosaunee visual arts over the centuries might turn up some connection.
    Bill says that he does not know of any oral tradition about that aspect of the dance.
    That is simply how it is done.
    Bill also notes that agricultural practices were already changing in the time of Handsome Lake, and so if the dance did connect to some specific aspect of corn planting, the link was probably lost a long time ago.

        In September 2023 the Allegany Singers recorded a set of Corn Dance songs for this project in the cookhouse of the Steamburg Community Center on <em class="seneca">Ohi:yo’</em>, next to Coldspring Longhouse
        <aac:paren><aac:ref type="video" href="#vid:corn-coldspring" /></aac:paren>.

        Jake led the group in Dowdy’s song 1, 2, 5, 13, and a variant of 9.
        Suited to his higher voice, Jake chose a pitch level one step higher (<q>final</q> on G instead of Dowdy’s F).
        His tempos were much slower, at about 60 beats per minute instead of Dowdy’s 78.
        Otherwise the songs were almost identical, with song 2 differing by only a single pitch, and one different vocable in song 5 (<em>Hai</em> for the first syllable instead of <em>We</em>) and in song 13 (<em>weayo:</em> instead of <em>weniyo</em>).
        </p>
        <p>
        After the <q>minor</q> opening, Jake selected only <q>major</q> songs.
        Jake also selected only songs in a call-and-response texture.
        As already <a href="#sec:corn-music-antiphonal">noted</a>, the group sang a variant antiphonal version of Dowdy’s song 9, whereas Dowdy’s version was in unison.

        <h3>Bill Crouse and the Allegany Singers, 2023</h3>
        <p>
        In fall 2023 Bill Crouse recorded two sets of Corn Dance songs: one at Ganondagan (Victor, New York) with his daughters singing the responses, and one with the Allegany Singers and Dancers for Indigenous Peoples’ Day at Genesee Valley Park in Rochester, New York.
        With his daughters, Bill selected four songs, equivalent to Dowdy’s songs 1, 2, 4, and 7.
        Unsurprisingly he sang song 2 the same way Jake did in 2022; the others are nearly identical to Dowdy’s version except that Bill sings different words to song 7 (<em>Yo:nava</em> instead of <em>Yo:ono</em>).
        <!-- TODO insert video -->
        <!-- TODO v vs w ? -->
        He selected all call-and-response songs and only the last one has a <q>minor</q> collection.
        Typical of Bill’s relatively more intense singing style, his final was much higher, close to B<aac:fl />; the tempo was faster than Jake at 75 beats per minute, but slower than Jesse Cornplanter (who may have been hurrying to fit things onto a limited recording medium, see <a href="#sec:corn-versions-cornplanter">below</a>).
        </p>
        <p>
        For the Indigenous Peoples’ Day presentation, Bill selected Dowdy’s songs 1, 2, 4, and 9.
        All were <q>major</q> and antiphonal, since Bill led song 9 as a call-and-response song in the same way Jake did in 2022.
        Characteristic of this veteran performer, Bill’s final and tempo were almost exactly the same as in his recording from a month previous.

        <h3>Jesse Cornplanter, 1948 and 1954</h3>
        <p>
        Three recordings of Jesse Cornplanter singing Corn Dance songs survive among William Fenton’s papers (<a href="https://search.amphilsoc.org/collections/view?docId=ead/Mss.Rec.138-ead.xml">American Philosophical Society Mss. Rec. 138.06/02-01, 138.07/04-01, and 138.07/04.16</a>).
        They were recorded at the Tonawanda Reservation, on August 26, 1948, and March 23, 1954.
        (The earlier one specifies it was recorded at Cornplanter’s house.)
        A third recording is probably from the same 1954 session.
        Cornplanter introduces the 1948 recording as the Seneca Corn Dance, <q>Newtown version</q>.
        That recording also includes an interview with William Fenton and Gertrude Kurath.
        </p>
        <p>
        Cornplanter sings ten songs on the 1948 recording, comparing to the 2002 Dowdy reference version
        <aac:paren>
        <aac:ref type="table" href="#tab:corn-cornplanter-1948">tables</aac:ref>
        <aac:ref type="table" href="#tab:corn-cornplanter-1954"> and</aac:ref>
        </aac:paren>.
        The shorter 1954 recording, a fragment, includes two songs: Dowdy song 12, and then Dowdy song 13 and 2 combined.
        </p>
        <xi:include href="../tables/corn-cornplanter-1948.xhtml" />
        <xi:include href="../tables/corn-cornplanter-1954.xhtml" />
        <p>
        In 1948, Cornplanter’s final was around F<aac:sh />, and the 1954 recordings were slightly lower in pitch, on E (longer recording) and F<aac:na />.
        His tempo slowed down for each successive recording, from 92 beats per minute in 1948 to 90 and then 85 in 1954.
        </p>
        <p>
        These recordings, stemming from practice at Newtown, include four unique songs that the Allegany Singers never recorded (in the 1948 recording, Cornplanter’s songs 2, 3, 7, and 9).
        The others only differ slightly from those sung at <em class="seneca">Ohi:yo’</em> today.
        The unique songs are most similar in style and outline to Dowdy’s song 14, following a three-phrase pattern similar to <em>ab cd cd</em>
        (<aac:ref type="music" href="#mus:corn-cornplanter-song7" />).
        <!-- TODO table?

          7: abc de d'e?
          9: abc b' c'
        -->
        They all share a <q>major</q> pitch collection of <aac:pcset n="0 2 4 7 9" />; in the 1948 recording Cornplanter’s song 9 adds <aac:degree n="4" /> to produce a set of <aac:pcset n="0 2 4 5 7 9" />.

        </figure>
        <p>
        In each recorded set, Cornplanter also sings songs that combine separate ones in the Allegany Singers’ recordings: he combines Dowdy’s songs 13 and 2 as a single song, and does the same with 13 and 2.
        Though the recording, with only one singer, does not make clear which parts are antiphonal, Dowdy’s song 13 and 14 are unison (with perhaps the remnant of what used to be a response), while song 2 has an obvious call-and-response texture.
        </p>
        <p>
        In an interview with William Fenton and Gertrude Kurath on the 1948 recording, Cornplanter explains how he learned the songs and identifies two songs as originating at Onondaga:

          <span class="speaker">William Fenton: </span>
          Let’s talk about the Corn Dance a moment, Jesse. 
          Where did these songs you sang originate? 
          Where did they come from?
          </p>
          <p>
          <span class="speaker">Jesse Cornplanter: </span>
          According to my memory, from what I heard, it has always been used amongst us Seneca longhouses, ages, ages back, handed down from one singer to another.
          And the way I sing is just the way I was taught.
          </p>
          <p>
          <span class="speaker">Fenton: </span>
          Who taught you to sing these songs?
          </p>
          <p>
          <span class="speaker">Cornplanter: </span>
          My father was a great singer of all those social and other ceremonial dances. 
          And then he taught me all those songs.
          </p>
          <p>
          <span class="speaker">Fenton: </span>
          So your father was Edward Cornplanter, the one they call <em>Sošendo:wah</em>?
          </p>
          <p>
          <span class="speaker">Cornplanter: </span> 
          Yes he was.
          </p>
          <p>
          <span class="speaker">Fenton: </span>
          There were two songs that you told me while we were playing it back, that your father brought with him from Onondaga. 
          Which two songs were they? 
          If we could identify those on the record, it would make it easier.
          </p>
          <p>
          <span class="speaker">Cornplanter: </span> 
          It was that song that goes like this: 
          [sings the start of his song 8]
          That was one of ’em.
          </p>
          <p>
          <span class="speaker">Fenton: </span>
          And what was the other song that your father brought back from Onondaga longhouse?
          </p>
          <p>
          <span class="speaker">Cornplanter: </span> 
          [sings the start of his song 7]
          Those are the ones.
          </p>
          <p>
          <span class="speaker">Fenton: </span>
          Those are the two that came from Onondaga longhouse near Syracuse, New York?
          </p>
          <p>
          <span class="speaker">Cornplanter: </span> 
          Right.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
        The first of the two songs Cornplanter says came from Onondaga is the same as Dowdy’s song 10; the other is only recorded by Cornplanter.
        Were these songs originally part of Corn Dance at Tonawanda but then lost, and had to be restored from the Onondaga repertoire?
        Did they also come to Allegany from Onondaga, or were they part of their practice all along?
        How many other songs in sets today were brought from other places?
        Only additional comparative study will tell.
