    <em class="seneca">Onëö’ oënö</em> or Corn Dance honors a food that both historically was one of the most important foods of the Seneca Nation.
    <aac:paren><aac:ref type="video" href="#vid:corn-coldspring" /></aac:paren>.
    Corn, or maize, (<em>Zea mays</em>) is an indigenous American domesticated crop, and together with beans and squash, corn is one of the Three Sisters, known in Seneca as <em class="seneca">Ha’denö:dë:nö:dë’ johehgöh</em> (the sisters, our Life Sustainers).
    Seneca people thank the Three Sisters specifically in the <em class="seneca">Gano:nyök</em>, and this dance connects to that practice of gratitude for the domesticated plants that provide people with food.
    We could group Corn Dance with other food-centered Earth Songs, including Shake the Bush (for beans) and Pigeon Dance (originally for passenger pigeons, which were used as food).

    Corn Dance was originally a ceremonial dance used in seasonal celebrations of the Three Sisters, but for at least a century it has been a social dance at <em>Ohi:yo’</em>.
    At Tonawanda, by contrast, the dance was restored to its ceremonial use in the mid-twentieth century.
    Since this project is based on Bill Crouse’s practice at Allegany, we share it here and ask the understanding of those whose local protocol differs.

    The dancers moves in a back-and-forth, snaking motion reminiscent of sowing corn kernels.
    The songs mostly use a call-and-response texture, again like Standing Quiver and contrasting with many other Earth Songs.
    Perhaps growing out of the same principle of alternation seen in the dance, the songs alternate within songs between leader and singers, and between songs in pitch collections that sound relatively <q>minor</q> or <q>major</q>.
    Most of the songs seem to follow the melodic and phrasing outline of either the first or the second traditional song in the set.
    Given the dance’s historic connection with corn agriculture, some form of Corn Dance has likely been cultivated in this land for as long as there has been corn here, which archaeologists estimate to at least two thousand years.

      Corn Dance extends gratitude and recognition to corn as one of the Three Sisters along with beans and squash, who are the Life Sustainers of the Haudenosaunee people.
      In the Haudenosaunee Creation story, corn was a gift from Sky Woman to her children at the beginning of human life.
      Traditional stories describe the three plants in the forms of human sisters, each of whom offers something unique to help humans, as in this story told by a Mohawk elder:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
      Once upon a time very long ago, there were three sisters who lived together in a field. 
      These sisters were quite different from one another in their size and also in their way of dressing. 
      One of the three was a little sister, so young that she could only crawl at first and she was dressed in green. 
      The second of the three wore a frock of bright yellow and she had a way of running off by herself when the sun shone and the soft wind blew in her face. 
      The third was the eldest sister, standing always very straight and tall above the other sisters and trying to guard them. 
      She wore a pale green shawl, and she had long yellow hair that tossed about her head in the breezes.
      There was only one way in which the three sisters were alike. They loved one another very dearly, and they were never separated
      <aac:citation key="Ganondagan:ThreeSisters" />.
      </blockquote>
      <p>
      Describing nineteenth-century Seneca teachings in almost identical language, Lewis Henry Morgan tried to explain,  
      <q>This last belief is illustrated by the natural adaptation of the plants themselves to grow up together in the same field, and perhaps from the same hill</q>
      <aac:citation key="Morgan:League" pages="161" />.
      But Morgan typically does not give enough credit to Indigenous indigenuity: plots of corn, beans, and squash growing together are no <q>natural</q> occurrence or accident, but an invention developed by ancient Americans in dynamic relationship with these plants.
      </p>
      <p>
      Indigenous people in what is now central Mexico domesticated corn about six thousand years ago
      <aac:citation key="AtlasNAmericanIndian" pages="30" />, and archaeological evidence shows that people began growing corn in today’s Seneca territory as early as 100 CE, with widespread cultivation by 900 CE

      All of the Six Nations’ languages share cognate words for corn with the same root as the Seneca <em class="seneca">onëö’</em>, which suggests that the languages diverged from Cherokee and others in the Iroquoian family after the first introduction of corn
      <aac:citation key="Schillaci:IroquoianLinguisticClues" />.
      <q>The development of more frost-resistant strains of corn, and the full use of the great trio of native plants—corn, beans, and squash—increased storable food resources</q> and contributed greatly to the flourishing of Native communities

      Like many other Native Americans, Seneca people cultivated corn together with beans and squash as the Three Sisters.
      According to the Potawottami biologist and ecologist Robin Wall Kimmerer,
      the three plants grow in such a way that each complements the other: the
      corn grows straight and tall, providing a pole for the vining beans to
      climb, while the squash spreads out along the base, protecting the plants
      from weeds and insects
      <aac:citation key="Kimmerer:Sweetgrass" pages="128–140" />.
      The beans provide nitrogen that the other plants need.
      When eaten together, each food balances out what the others lack to provide complete nutrition for humans.
      </p>
      <p>
      Charred remnants from the inside of clay cooking pots from about two thousand years ago indicate that people in this region were cooking corn in ways that would still be recognizable to Seneca people today
      <aac:citation key="Hart:MaizeNY" />.
      Two of the most common traditional ways of preparing corn are <em class="seneca">onò:hgwa’</em> (corn soup, <aac:ref type="video" href="#vid:corn-soup" />) and <em class="seneca">gá:hdok</em> (cornbread).
      Both recipes start by soaking parched corn in water with ash, an indigenous invention (called <em>nixtamalization</em> after the Náhuatl term for it) that greatly enhances the nutritional value of corn, as Sioux chef Sean Sherman explains
      <aac:citation key="Sherman:SiouxChef" pages="47–49" />.
      Within the traditional Seneca community, corn soup plays an important role in ceremonial life.
      <!-- TODO examples -->
      Non-native people can find corn soup at powwows and public cultural festivals on Haudenosaunee territory.
      The Iroquois White Corn Project at Ganondagan State Historic Site, founded by visionary Seneca leader John Mohawk, works <q>to restore the farming, consumption, and distribution of traditional White Corn to Native American communities and to offer White Corn products to the community at large,</q> using <q>heirloom seeds dating back at least 1,400 years in Haudenosaunee communities</q>

      The Euro-American colonizers also understood that corn was a <q>life sustainer</q> of the Haudenosaunee; that is why they repeatedly targeted their corn supplies and fields.
      In 1687 the French Marquis Denonville, in the expedition that destroyed the city at Ganondagan, reported that while they were at <q>the four Seneca villages <aac:dots /> All that time we spent in destroying the corn, which in such great abundance, that the loss, including old corn which was in <em>cache</em> which we burnt, and that which was standing, was computed according to the estimate afterwards made, at four hundred thousand minots [1.2 million bushels] of Indian corn</q>
      <aac:citation pre="quoted in" key="Morgan:League" pages="199" />.
      In the midst of the US Revolutionary War in 1779, General George Washington ordered Major General John Sullivan to tear through Seneca country effecting <q>total destruction and devastation of their settlements</q>, writing
      <q>It will be essential to ruin their crops now in the ground and prevent their planting more</q>
      <aac:citationList>
      <aac:citation key="Washington:SullivanCampaign" />
      <aac:citation key="NPS:ClintonSullivan" />
      </aac:citationList>.
      Lewis Henry Morgan, writing at the height of the grain-export boom that made Rochester the <q>Flour City</q>, described corn as <q>one of the gifts of the Indian to the world</q> and recognized that the security of <q>our entire race</q> (the white race, he meant) could depend on the corn supplies grown on ancestral Indian land
      <aac:citation key="Morgan:League" pages="370–374" />.
      </p>
      <p>
      From a Western perspective it might seem that songs and dances are merely folkloric, tangential to the science and business of food production, but from a traditional Haudenosaunee outlook, agriculture and culture are closely intertwined.
      Dances like Corn Dance are not just <q>about</q> corn, but are an integral part of how the community relates to and maintains their food sources, and traditionally were actually part of the planting and harvesting processes.
      In fact, according to Seneca oral tradition, dance is the only reason we still have corn.
      </p>
      <p>
      As Bill Crouse tells the story, when the late-eighteenth-century prophet Handsome Lake was walking between the ripe corn in late summer, he heard the Corn Spirit speaking to him in the whispering of the leaves.
      The people had lost track of the Creator’s Original Instructions, she
      told him, and were living in disorder; so she had decided to leave the
      land.
      The prophet begged her to stay and asked what the people needed to do to repair their relationship.
      She told him to have the people sing a specific set of songs dedicated to her in a Ceremony of Seven Dances for the Three Sisters.
      Today at <em class="seneca">Ohi:yo’</em> there are now ten songs; at Cattaraugus they still do seven.
      (This is where Corn Dance is done today at Tonawanda.)
      The songs of those dances (not Corn Dance) go through the whole agricultural life cycle of corn from planting to harvest.
      </p>
      <p>
      Though this story is not about the social Corn Dance we are discussing here, it shows that dance and song were integral to the domestication and growing of corn; the people needed songs and ceremonies to revive the agricultural practices.
      Similar to <a href="robin.html">Robin Dance</a>, the non-human being gives these songs to the people as a way for them to maintain a proper reciprocal relationship with them.
      The traditional teachings reminded people that should they neglect their relationships with the life-sustaining plants, they could lose them, as Robin Wall Kimmerer says about a similar story that recurs across Native North America:
      <q>One of our responsibilities as human people is to find ways to enter into reciprocity with the more-than-human world.
      We can do it through gratitude, through ceremony, through land stewardship, science, art, and in everyday acts of practical reverence</q>
      <aac:citation key="Kimmerer:Sweetgrass" pages="190" />.
      Corn Dance, whether done as part of these Three Sisters ceremonies or as a social dance, provides a way for people to orient themselves in a good way in relationships to the corn, a way rooted in gratitude and responsibility.

      <h2>Ceremonial vs. Social Use</h2>
      <p>
      On the Allegany territory of the Seneca Nation, the local practice of which is the basis for this project, Corn Dance is a social dance and therefore appropriate for sharing with the public.
      At Tonawanda, however, Corn Dance is considered a ceremonial dance today and therefore some from that community may object to the dance’s inclusion here.
      Originally it was probably a ceremonial song everywhere, but Tonawanda Seneca Jesse Cornplanter reported in the 1940s that for many years it had been used as a social song on his territory.

      <p>
      Cornplanter noted that Corn Dance was in the process of being restored to a ceremonial use, and since then it has become an exclusively ceremonial song at Tonawanda.
      Nevertheless, it has remained a social song on the Allegany Territory and elsewhere, and Bill Crouse has regularly shared Corn Dance with public audiences, Native and settler, for decades.
      </p>
      <p>
      Bill’s teachers told him that all of the social dances at one time were ceremonial, but over time they lost their ceremonial functions.
      In his view, Corn Dance is just one of the dances to change its function more recently.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="sec:corn-age">
      <h2>How Old is Corn Dance?</h2>
      <p>
      Could Corn Dance be as old as corn is in Seneca territory?
      (That is, two thousand years old, which would give it a similar vintage to what may be the oldest surviving Christian liturgical chants in the West.)
      Jesse Cornplanter, asked by Fenton how he learned the Corn Dance songs, replied, <q>According to my memory, from what I heard, it has always been used amongst us Seneca longhouses, ages, ages back, handed down from one singer to another.
        And the way I sing is just the way I was taught</q>
      (<aac:ref type="video" href="TODO" />).
      Without recordings or notated music from before the twentieth century we cannot answer whether or how much these songs may have changed over time in their musical details, but there has been remarkable continuity in the agricultural practices of Seneca corn growing and in the whole set of beliefs and ceremonies supporting those practices.
      These practices were already so well established in the time of Handsome Lake, circa 1790, that some of them were already falling into disuse and needed to be revived.
      Corn was one of the cultural practices that the Haudenosaunee nations had in common before Peacemaker visited them, one of the kindred cultural practices like building longhouses that enabled him to form the league to begin with.
      The idea of the Three Sisters is not a folkloric or religious add-on to the agricultural practices; just as the story about Handsome Lake teachers, without the cultural practices connected to the Three Sisters there might be no corn at all.
      </p>
      <p>
      Those practices have probably always included some kinds of songs and dances offered in reciprocal relationship with these plant beings.
      One source of evidence for the longevity of music, dance, and ceremonial practices are the archaeological remains of turtle-shell rattles in Haudenosaunee sites from one thousand years ago, when corn cultivation was becoming widespread
      <aac:citationList>
      <aac:citation key="Pearce:Turtles" />
      <aac:citation key="Sturtevant:IroquoisInstruments" />
      </aac:citationList>.
      (Turtle-shell rattles have been found elsewhere in North America from as early as ten thousand years ago, from the very earliest period of human settlement on the continent; 
      <aac:citation type="plain" key="GillreathBrown:TurtleRattles" />).
      Descriptions of turtle-shell and horn rattles appear in the earliest European descriptions of Iroquoian peoples, such as the Jesuit Lafitau’s 1724 account
      <aac:citation key="Lafitau:Moeurs" pages="215" />.
      </p>
      <p>
      The physical movements of the Corn Dance could even be related to specific ancient practices of sowing and harvesting corn which may be documentable in the archaeological record.
      <!-- TODO  connection between actual planting practices and Corn Dance choreography? -->
      Whether the tunes of Corn Dance songs have changed over the years or not, their social function and meaning remained consistent across centuries.
      Only with the upheavals brought on by colonization did Corn Dance shift from being a specific part of Three Sisters ceremonies to being a social dance, and then, at Tonawanda, back to ceremony.
      </p>
      <p>
      It seems reasonable to conclude, then, that there has been some kind of Corn Dance heard on the fertile fields of the Genesee Valley and across Seneca territory for as long as corn has been planted there.
      Long before settlers sang of the <q>amber waves of grain</q> as a central symbol of their country, before corn became a staple for the whole planet, Seneca people and their ancestors were singing some form of Corn Dance on their territory.
      That dance is not just as a sentimental celebration of corn; it is an active way of maintaining a mutually sustaining relationship with the plants that sustain human life.

      <h2>Words</h2>
      <p>
      As with other Earth Songs, the words of Corn Dance are vocables with no linguistic meaning
      <aac:paren><aac:ref type="table" href="#tab:corn-dowdy-words" /></aac:paren>.
      Most of the songs include a version of the antiphonal response <em>hai:wihah</em>.
      Songs with similar vocables are usually similar in other ways, as in the several songs that include <em>weniyo:h</em>, <em>wenuya:h</em>, and <em>weganawiyo:h</em>.
      A few recurring vocables sound like Seneca words—<em>wiyo:h</em> (it’s good), <em>ne:wa’</em> (turn, as in <q>your turn</q>), <em>onë:h</em> (now)—but this is probably just coincidence.

      <h2>Musical Structure (Andrew)</h2>
      <p>
      In this section I (Andrew) present my own analysis of the Corn Dance songs, as I hear them, acknowledging that this is only my perspective, not part of the oral tradition, and undoubtedly shaped by my own Eurocentric training.
      </p>
      <p>
      As with other social dances, the songs for Corn Dance bear a strong family resemblance to each other even though they contrast in many ways.
      Every live and recorded performance that I have heard includes the same first two songs (or to label it another way, the same introduction and first song).
      That is notable because all the other songs seem to be related to one or the other of those first two songs.
      </p>
      <section id="sec:overview">
        <h3>Songs 1–2 as Model for the Others</h3>
        <p>
        The opening song, or introduction, is in free tempo (no steady beat).
        The lead singer starts with the first phrase (<em>Eyo:h ha:dine:h</em>) and then the other singers join in unison for the continuation.
        Their melody follows a descending outline.
        In the 2002 Allegany Singers recording with Kyle Dowdy singing lead, Kyle begins on approximately <aac:pitch pname="C" oct="4" />.
        The phrases move down from C to B<aac:fl /> and B<aac:fl /> to A<aac:fl />, outlining a stepwise major third.
        Then the last phrase jumps down to F, dips down to low C, and back up to end on F (outlining a perfect fifth), before the concluding <em>Yo:ho:h</em> on C.
        If this were a Gregorian chant I would say it had a reciting tone of C and an F final.
        It outlines the pitch collection <aac:pcset n="0 3 5 7" />, which for convenience I will call <q>minor</q> because the bottom third (F–A<aac:fl />) is a minor (smaller) third.
        </p>
        <p>
        After this slow, solemn, minor-sounding introduction in unison, the next song contrasts in every way: there is now a steady beat supported by the horn rattles; the melody is now a call-and-response between leader and the other singers, and the melody now outlines a major-sounding collection, <aac:pcset n="0 2 4 7" />.
        Though as usual Seneca singers do not have to maintain a steady pitch level, in most versions the final stays the same, so the effect is of shifting from minor to major keys.
        The mood shifts with the change of scales, becoming lighter, more energetic, and more march-like.
        <!-- ?? -->
        In phrase structure, there is now a first pair of phrases, repeated, ending on the F final; followed by a contrasting middle phrase on G (<aac:degree n="2" />), and then multiple repeats of the first pair of phrases.
        Despite these differences, there are commonalities with the introductory song: the melody still traces a descending major third at the beginning and a perfect fifth, dipping down to low C, at the end.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="sec:pitches">
        <h3>Pitch Collections</h3>
        <p>
        All the other songs in Kyle Dowdy’s recording can be grouped as being more similar to one of these two songs, distinguished by having a base of either a <q>minor</q> (<aac:pcset n="0 3 5 7" />) collection, or <q>major</q> (<aac:pcset n="0 2 4 7" />), with other pitches added in some songs
        <aac:paren><aac:ref type="table" href="#tab:corn-pitches" /></aac:paren>.
        Song 11 is the only one that mixes major and minor collections, including both A<aac:fl /> and A<aac:na />.
        </p>
        <xi:include href="../tables/corn-pitches.xhtml" />
        <xi:include href="../tables/corn-pitches-grouped.xhtml" />
        <p>
        These songs are distinguished by using a limited number of pitches.
        Eight of the seventeen songs have only four pitches; five are pentatonic.
        Only four songs have more than five pitches, and of those, only song 11—the one that mixes major and minor—has seven pitches.
        Though the songs based on the <pcset n="0 2 4 7" /> collection sound minor, no songs in this set include <aac:degree accid="fl" n="6" />.
        This is a higher proportion of songs with five or fewer pitches than in <em class="seneca">Gayo:waga:yöh</em> (Old Moccasin Dance, mostly six-tone), and much higher than the mostly diatonic <em class="seneca">Ë:sgä:nye:’</em> (New Women’s Shuffle Dance) songs.
        Among dances I’ve studied so far, only <em class="seneca">Jö:yaik oënö’</em> (Robin Dance) has more songs with five or fewer pitches (out of six Robin Dance songs on the recordeding studied, four have four tones and 2 have five).
        There is more variation in the <em class="seneca">Ga’da:šo:t</em> (Standing Quiver Dance) songs, which include a similar alternation between major- and minor-sounding collections.
        The set of pitches used in an Earth Song forms part of the <q>palette</q> distinctive to that dance and is one element that creates the sense of family relationships within the songs.
        Comparison of pitch collections may be one data point that could eventually be used to establish relative dates of the Earth Songs—could those with fewer pitches perhaps be older?—though vastly more research is needed.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="sec:phrases">
        <h3>Phrases and Formal Structure</h3>
        <p>
        Similar to Old Moccasin Dance, the songs for Corn Dance can be grouped into only a few types of phrase structures.
        I hear three phrases in the opening song, where the last two phrases have the same ending: <em>a bc dc</em>.
        The largest group of phrase structures we can identify follows this three-phrase pattern and includes nine songs.
        The next group follows the pattern of song 2 (the first <q>major</q> song, with call-and-response).
        Three songs in this group have three sections with repeated first and third sections, for example <em>aaaa b aaaa</em> or <em>ab ab ab c ab ab ab</em>.
        The last group of phrase structures, including four songs, has four phrases in two parallel groups, where the even-numbered subphrases end the same way, for example <em>ab cd, cb cd</em> or <em>a b c b<aac:prime /></em>.
        </p>
        <p>
        While pitch collections do not correlate with these groups—there are <q>minor</q> and <q>major</q> songs in both three- and four-phrase groups—songs within one of these three phrasing groups do follow similar melodic outlines.
        The three-phrase songs follow the basic descending pattern of the opening song: 
        <aac:degree n="5" />–<aac:degree n="4" />–<aac:degree n="3" />–<aac:degree n="1" />(–low <aac:degree n="5" />–<aac:degree n="1" />).
        Notably both <q>minor</q> and <q>major</q> songs with this phrasing follow that same descending outline.
        The four-phrase songs, all <q>minor</q>, also outline the same descent but their parallel phrase structure requires them to repeat the last part of it:
        <aac:degree n="5" />–<aac:degree n="4" />–<aac:degree n="3" />–<aac:degree n="1" />–<aac:degree n="3" />–<aac:degree n="1" />(–low <aac:degree n="5" />–<aac:degree n="1" />).
        One could certainly hear these four-phrase songs as just the same pattern as the three-phrase songs, extended by repeating the final phrase.
        The other group, the three-section call-and-response songs, use a different outline, stressing <aac:degree n="1" /> in the first and last sections, and a contrasting <aac:degree n="2" /> in the middle section.
        </p>

      </section>
      <section id="sec:corn-music-antiphonal">
        <h3>Call and Response</h3>
        <p>
        As in the Standing Quiver Dance (and unlike many other Earth Songs), several of the songs in Corn Dance are antiphonal: that is, they feature a call-and-response texture.
        The string of <q>major</q> songs in Dowdy’s set, songs 2–5 all feature short call-and-response phrases with the response <em>hai:wihah</em>.
        In Dowdy’s version, the following songs are all unison except song 7, until the final song closes with an antiphonal section (<em>wigoh</em>/<em>aheh</em>).
        </p>
        <p>
        Are there traces, though, of antiphonal texture in the other songs?
        Several of the <q>unison</q> songs feature repetitive phrases and response-like phrases that suggest these songs might once have been sung antiphonally, or that they descend from earlier antiphonal versions.
        Dowdy’s songs 6 and 7 are intriguing in this respect: they contain the same melodic and rhythmic material, but song 6 is unison and song 7 is call-and-response.
        In song 7, the melody that was used in song 6 is now broken up into phrases sung by the lead singer, to which the others respond <em>hai:eh ya:hah</em> in quarter notes (one-beat notes) on F (the final).
        That response was already present in song 6 but there it was part of the unison melody.
        <!-- example -->
        Other songs include the same kind of perhaps-vestigial response phrase: song 12 (<em>hai:eh ga:ha-ah</em>), 13 (same as previous), 14 (<em>ya:ha-ah</em>), and 15 (<em>hai:eh ga:ha-ah</em>).
        Could these songs once have been antiphonal, or are there antiphonal versions of them?
        </p>
        <p>
        Similarly, in the later Allegany Singers recording (2022) with Jake George singing lead, the group sings a variant that is identical in every way to Dowdy’s song 9, except antiphonal instead of unison.
        In the later version, all the repeated phrases are sung as call and response, where Dowdy had the groups sing both call and response together.
        <!-- example -->
        </p>
        <p>
        Of course, when Jesse Cornplanter recorded Corn Dance songs by himself in 1948 and 1954, out of necessity he sang both call and response in all his antiphonal songs.
        Did recordings like that perhaps contribute to some confusion about which songs were antiphonal, or about which parts of those songs were the call and which the response?
        Or was there a common practice of treating the antiphonal parts as optional?

      <section id="sec:corn-music-conclusions">
        <h3>Conclusions and Questions</h3>
        <p>
        Considering all of these analytical observations together, I would propose, first, that the basic outlines of the first two songs form the basis of all the others.
        Most of the call-and-response songs follow song 2 in collection, phrasing, melodic outline, and style.
        Most of the unison songs follow song 1 in phrasing and melodic outline, though some match the outline of song 1 with the collection of song 2.
        In two cases, there are highly similar songs in both the three- and four-phrase groups:
        song 7 (three phrases) repeats the same melodic and rhythmic material as song 6 (four phrases), but with a different phrase structure.
        Similarly song 17 (three phrases) is closely similar to song 15 (four phrases).
        That the same musical ideas can be used to make a song of both phrase types gives strength to the idea that this distinction of phrase types is important, and may help clarify how those types work.
        In an analogous fashion, sometimes the existence of a hybrid clarifies a principle of contrast elsewhere, as in song 11 that includes both <q>major</q> and <q>minor</q> elements within the same song.
        Likewise, the final song begins like a three-phrase song in unison but then ends with a repeated antiphonal section that recalls song 2, reinforcing the contrast between unison and call-and-response textures.
        </p>
        <xi:include href="../tables/corn-phrases.xhtml" />
        <p>
        These conclusions raise several questions that I hope to answer with further research:
        <ul>
          <li>Is there a principle of contrast at work here, between minor and major collections, three- and four-phrase structures, antiphonal and unison textures?</li>
          <li>Is that principle related to other aspects of Corn Dance, for example the way its choreography involves frequent changes of direction as though sowing seeds?</li>
          <li>Is there a difference between dances that include songs with a family resemblance and dances where all the songs are essentially variants of the same tune, as in Robin Dance, and perhaps with the Corn Dance songs that seem to be modeled on song 1?</li>
          <li>Despite the major/minor (<aac:degree accid="fl" n="3" />/<aac:degree accid="na" n="3" />) contrast between songs, is the real common thread the descending stepwise major third (C–B<aac:fl />–A<aac:fl /> or A–G–F)? Or is this negated by the fact that song 11 features both minor and major <aac:degree n="3" />?</li>
          <li>Most intriguingly, is the prevalence of limited-collection, 4-pitch songs an indication of age or longevity?
            Could this or any other musical feature be used to establish relative dates of this and other songs?</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
        The second major conclusion I would draw is to speculate that Corn Dance was originally all antiphonal.
        Even most of the unison songs contain elements that sound like responses, or feature repetitive phrase endings that may derive from responses.
        <ul>
          <li>Is the antiphonal character why this and Standing Quiver, which is also (mostly) antiphonal, are the only dances in which the singers must move in the line with the dancers rather that staying stationary off to one side. </li>
          <li>Is the antiphonal texture part of the principle of contrast or alternation discussed above?</li>
          <li>Is it connected to the idea of the community going out into the fields, similar to Standing Quiver with its concept of going on a journey?</li>
          <li>Are there vestigial or embedded responses in other Earth Songs that are now sung as unison?</li>
          <li>Do the antiphonal vs. unison shifts related to Corn Dance’s shifting status as a ceremonial vs. social song, and the differing phases of its use in Three Sisters ceremonies? (And why did the people stop using Corn Dance for ceremony?)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Jake George and the Allegany Singers, 2022</h3>
        <p>
        In September 2023 the Allegany Singers recorded a set of Corn Dance songs for this project in the cookhouse of the Steamburg Community Center on <em class="seneca">Ohi:yo’</em>, next to Coldspring Longhouse
        <aac:paren><aac:ref type="video" href="#vid:corn-coldspring" /></aac:paren>.
        Jake George sang lead.
        The set was very close to that recorded by the same group 21 years earlier with Kyle Dowdy singing lead.
        Jake led the group in Dowdy’s song 1, 2, 5, 13, and a variant of 9.
        Suited to his higher voice, Jake chose a pitch level one step higher (<q>final</q> on G instead of Dowdy’s F).
        His tempos were much slower, at about 60 beats per minute instead of Dowdy’s 78.
        Otherwise the songs were almost identical, with song 2 differing by only a single pitch, and one different vocable in song 5 (<em>Hai</em> for the first syllable instead of <em>We</em>) and in song 13 (<em>weayo:</em> instead of <em>weniyo</em>).
        </p>
        <p>
        After the <q>minor</q> opening, Jake selected only <q>major</q> songs.
        Jake also selected only songs in a call-and-response texture.
        For this recording the group sang a variant antiphonal version of Dowdy’s song 9, whereas Dowdy’s version was in unison.
        The repeated phrases in this song make more sense as calls and responses.

        <h3>Bill Crouse and the Allegany Singers, 2023</h3>
        <p>
        In fall 2023 Bill Crouse recorded two sets of Corn Dance songs: one at Ganondagan (Victor, New York) with his daughters singing the responses, and one with the Allegany Singers and Dancers for Indigenous Peoples’ Day at Genesee Valley Park in Rochester, New York.
        With his daughters, Bill selected four songs, equivalent to Dowdy’s songs 1, 2, 4, and 7.
        Unsurprisingly he sang song 2 the same way Jake did in 2022; the others are nearly identical to Dowdy’s version except that Bill sings different words to song 7 (<em>Yo:nava</em> instead of <em>Yo:ono</em>).
        <!-- TODO v vs w ? -->
        He selected all call-and-response songs and only the last one has a <q>minor</q> collection.
        Typical of Bill’s relatively more intense singing style, his final was much higher, close to B<aac:fl />; the tempo was faster than Jake at 75 beats per minute, but slower than Jesse Cornplanter (who may have been hurrying to fit things onto a limited recording medium, see <a href="#sec:corn-versions-cornplanter">below</a>).
        </p>
        <p>
        For the Indigenous Peoples’ Day presentation, Bill selected Dowdy’s songs 1, 2, 4, and 9.
        All were <q>major</q> and antiphonal, since Bill led song 9 as a call-and-response song in the same way Jake did in 2022.
        Characteristic of this veteran performer, Bill’s final and tempo were almost exactly the same as in his recording from a month previous.

        <h3>Jesse Cornplanter, 1948 and 1954</h3>
        <p>
        Three recordings of Jesse Cornplanters singing Corn Dance songs survive in the American Philosophical Society as part of William Fenton’s papers.
        They were recorded at the Tonawanda Reservation, on August 26, 1948, and March 23, 1954.
        (The earlier one specifies it was recorded at Cornplanter’s house.)
        A third recording is probably from the same 1954 session.
        <!-- 
          1948: APS Mss.Rec. 138.06/02.01
          1954: APS Mss.Rec. 138.07/04.01 138.07/04.16
        -->
        Cornplanter introduces the 1948 recording as the Seneca Corn Dance, <q>Newtown version</q>.
        That recording also includes an interview with William Fenton and Gertrude Kurath.
        </p>
        <p>
        Cornplanter sings ten songs on the 1948 recording, comparing to the 2002 Dowdy reference version
        <aac:paren>
        <aac:ref type="table" href="#tab:corn-cornplanter-1948">tables</aac:ref>
        <aac:ref type="table" href="#tab:corn-cornplanter-1954"> and</aac:ref>
        </aac:paren>.
        The shorter 1954 recording, a fragment, includes two songs: Dowdy song 12, and then Dowdy song 13 and 2 combined.
        </p>
        <xi:include href="../tables/corn-cornplanter-1948.xhtml" />
        <xi:include href="../tables/corn-cornplanter-1954.xhtml" />
        <p>
        In 1948, Cornplanter’s final was around F<aac:sh />, and the 1954 recordings were slightly lower in pitch, on E (longer recording) and F<aac:na />.
        His tempo slowed down for each successive recording, from 92 beats per minute in 1948 to 90 and then 85 in 1954.
        </p>
        <p>
        These recordings, stemming from practice at Newtown, include four unique songs that the Allegany Singers never recorded (in the 1948 recording, Cornplanter’s songs 2, 3, 7, and 9).
        The others only differ slightly from those sung at <em class="seneca">Ohi:yo’</em> today.
        The unique songs are most similar in style and outline to Dowdy’s song 14, following a three-phrase pattern similar to <em>ab cd cd</em>.
        <!--
          2: ab cb' c'b'
          3: ab cb' b'd
          7: abc de d'e?
          9: abc b' c'
        -->
        They all share a <q>major</q> pitch collection of <aac:pcset n="0 2 4 7 9" />; in the 1948 recording Cornplanter’s song 9 adds <aac:degree n="4" /> to produce a set of <aac:pcset n="0 2 4 5 7 9" />.
        <!-- TODO more? -->
        </p>
        <p>
        In each recorded set, Cornplanter also sings songs that combine separate ones in the Allegany Singers’ recordings: he combines Dowdy’s songs 13 and 2 as a single song, and does the same with 13 and 2.
        Though the recording, with only one singer, does not make clear which parts are antiphonal, Dowdy’s song 13 and 14 are unison (with perhaps the remnant of what used to be a response), while song 2 has an obvious call-and-response texture.
        Cornplanter’s practice is interesting, then, because it would seem to strengthen the argument that a principle of contrast and alternation is central to Corn Dance, and restores an element of antiphony to unison songs that perhaps had lost it.
        </p>
        <p>
        In an interview with William Fenton and Gertrude Kurath on the 1948 recording, Cornplanter explains how he learned the songs and identifies two songs as originating at Onondaga:

          So your father was Edward Cornplanter, the one they call <em>Sošendo:wah</em>?
          </p>
          <p>
          <span class="speaker">Cornplanter: </span> 
          Yes he was.
          </p>
          <p>

          There were two songs that you told me while we were playing it back, that your father brought with him from Onondaga. 
          Which two songs were they? 
          If we could identify those on the record, it would make it easier.

          <span class="speaker">Cornplanter: </span> 
          It was that song that goes like this: 
          [sings the start of his song 8]
          That was one of ’em.
          </p>
          <p>
          <span class="speaker">Fenton: </span>
          And what was the other song that your father brought back from Onondaga longhouse?
          </p>
          <p>
          <span class="speaker">Cornplanter: </span> 
          [sings the start of his song 7]
          Those are the ones.
          </p>
          <p>
          <span class="speaker">Fenton: </span>
          Those are the two that came from Onondaga longhouse near Syracuse, New York?
          </p>
          <p>
          <span class="speaker">Cornplanter: </span> 
          Right.

        The first of the two songs Cornplanter says came from Onondaga is the same as Dowdy’s song 10; the other is only recorded by Cornplanter.
        Were these songs originally part of Corn Dance at Tonawanda but then lost, and had to be restored from the Onondaga repertoire?
        Did they also come to Allegany from Onondaga, or were they part of their practice all along?
        How many other songs in sets today were brought from other places?
        Only additional comparative study will tell.
