    Robin Dance is sung to honor the robin, especially at the start of spring, though it can be sung throughout the year.
    The song acknowledges and thanks the robin as a harbinger of spring after the long winter: as Bill says, <q>We’re honoring the robin, so we welcome it back</q>

    <h1>Story</h1>
    <p>
    According to Seneca oral tradition, the Robin Dance was a gift to the people from the robin, and the robin was originally a human boy.
    That boy went out into the woods with his uncle on a vision quest, and while he was fasting and waiting for a vision, he grew ill and began to waste away.
    His uncle found him on the point of death, with his chest painted red, but the boy begged to wait another day.
    When the uncle returned the last time, he found a bird who told him,
    <q>I am your nephew. I am <em class="seneca">jö:yaik</em>,</q> the robin, and from now on he would be the sign that spring was returning.
    He gave the people his songs as a way of honoring him and the promise of spring.

    The Seneca Robin Dance is evidence of a long, close relationship between humans and robins in this region, which Western science confirms.
    The American robin (<em class="latin">Turdus migratorius</em>) already lived all across North America when humans first arrived, but robins seem to have lived close by humans since
    <aac:citation key="CornellBirds:Robin" />.
    They prefer to hunt in grassy, open areas with plenty of sunlight, and so they thrive in human-settled landscapes or at the <q>woods’ edge</q>.
    In recent times scientists robin populations have been documented to expand following patterns of human settlement
    <aac:citation key="CornellBirds:Robin" />.
    Robins show awareness of people and their habits: city robins allow people to come much closer to them than their country cousins do, and they are less frightened of people walking on paths without looking at them, possibly because they have learned the predictable pattern that people tend to stay on paths
    <aac:citation key="Eason:RobinFlight" />.
    Human behavior shapes robin behavior: robins sing earlier in the morning when there is more light pollution
    <aac:citation key="Miller:RobinLightPollution" />,
    and robins in different cities show differing levels of fear toward humans 
    based on cultural differences in how humans there treat birds
    <aac:citation key="ClucasMarzluff:UrbanBirdAttitudes" />.
    </p>
    <p>
    Robins’ close proximity to humans, their easily identifiable song, and their seasonal return, make them one of the better-known birds even to urban settlers who do not otherwise pay much attention to birds.
    <q>Because the species is so widespread, virtually all North Americans hear, and are warmed by, the lovely melody of the robin during the spring and summer, although many people do not recognize its song as such.
      Those who do, however, widely regard the early migrating American robin to be  a longed-for harbinger of springtime and warmer weather, because this bird often arrives at the northern parts of its range and sings while there is still snow on the ground</q>

    The difference between the common folkloric ideas of robins and the Seneca Robin Dance is that Seneca people and their ancestors have lived side-by-side with this species of bird in this territory for thousands of years, and the song was developed and preserved through oral tradition as a sign of their close relationship.

    <h1>Songs</h1>
    <p>
    The Allegany Singers recorded six Robin Dance songs in 2002
    <aac:ref type="video" href="#vid:robin-score" />.
    In contrast to <a class="internal" href="quiver.html">Standing Quiver</a> and <a class="internal" href="moccasin.html">Old Moccasin Dance</a>, where one song can differ widely from the next, these Robin Dance songs sound more like variations on a single theme.

    The set begins with a slow introduction in free time, started by the lead singer and continued by the whole group.
    This introduction outlines the basic outline of the melody that will recur in all the songs.
    All the songs follow the same outline, which includes a smaller collection of pitches than some other songs
    (<aac:ref type="table" href="#tab:robin-pitches" />): 
    just <em>do</em>, <em>re</em>, <em>mi</em>, and <em>sol</em> or <em>la</em> (songs 5 and 6 include both).
    Though under Western training Andrew thinks of these pitches as belonging to a scale starting on E, the songs actually emphasize B much more strongly, both by stress and by including both the lower and higher B.
    When Robin Dance is sung in a reverberant space like the cookhouse used for both 2002 and 2022 Allegany Singers recordings, the repetition of only four or five notes, in repeated, short phrases with brief rests between, greatly reinforces the overtones resonating in the room to where Andrew found he could clearly hear the melody an octave and sometimes even two octaves higher resounding in the space.
    </p>
    <xi:include href="../tables/robin-pitches.xhtml" />
    <p>
    The melody in song 1 begins with repeated long one-beat notes (quarter notes as transcribed) on <em>yo:ho</em>, on <em>sol</em> (<aac:degree n="5" />), then moves down to a syncopated pattern on <em>mi–re</em>, followed by a dip down to low <em>sol</em> and back up to the middle register.
    There are three melodic phrases, and the second and third repeat the last portion of the first.
    This structure could be analyzed A-A'-A' or AB-B-B.
    </p>
    <p>
    Songs 2 and 3 vary the melody in song 1 in different ways: song 2 shortens the first phrase and alters one pitch (going down to <em>la</em> instead of <em>sol</em>).
    Song 3 expands the first phrase (from vocables of 11 syllables in song 1 to 16).
    </p>
    <p>
    Layout out the melodies graphically to show the repeating portions demonstrates that in each song the second and later phrases start by repeating the latter portion of the first phrase.
    Songs 4, 5, and 6 all have slightly different patterns of phrasing and repeated motives: song 4 could be labeled A-BC-BC, song 5 as A-BC-C'C, and song 6 as A-B-C-B.
    What all the songs have in common is that the subsequent phrases all repeat and vary some element of the preceding phrases.
    The effect of these partial repetitions and variations, especially with the frequent rests between phrases, seems to Andrew to create an effect similar to listening to repeating fragments of birdsong.
    </p>
    <p>
    The rhythmic patterns feature increasingly complex syncopation over a steady, moderate water-drum and horn-rattle beat at 100 beats per minute.
    The initial eighth-quarter-eighth syncopation in songs 1 and 2 expands in songs 3 and 4 into what sounds (to Andrew) like mixed meter, switching between groups of 2 and 3 eighth notes.
    In song 4, these syncopations actually shift the sense of pulse by an eighth note, so that the vocable <em>ya:ne</em> sounds like it is on the beat even though it does not actually coincide with the beats played on drum and rattle.
    The last song is the most syncopated, and here the rattle and drum players actually shift their beat to match with the melody, by adding a third eighth-note subdivision in between beat accents.

      <h2>Imitating Robin’s Song?</h2>
      <p>
      Could the Robin Dance songs have been created by imitating the song of the actual bird?
      Robin songs feature three or more repeated chirrups at a certain pace,
      about 100 beats per minute
      (<aac:ref type="video" href="#vid:robin-song" />).
      The first two chirrups stay fairly constant in timing and pitch across the sung.
      When robins vary the song it is usually in the <q>syllables</q> after that (discrete vocalizations that are part of a larger song), so that for example there might be four vocalizations and the last one would have a different type of contour.
      </p>

      </figure>
      <p>
      The Seneca dance songs also being with a repeated high-pitch call, <em>Yoh hoh yo:h</em>, at a similar pace to the bird’s, and in both of the Allegany Singers’ recordings, settles into a steady beat at 100 beats per minute
      (<aac:ref type="video" href="#vid:robin-coldspring" />
      <aac:ref type="video" href="#vid:robin-score"> and </aac:ref>).
      The rest of the Seneca melody is built of short, repetitive phrases of just a few notes each.
      That these phrases come after the high-pitch call may imitate the pattern in which the robin’s song variations happen after the first three chirrups.
      Moreover, the different Robin Dance songs are really variations on one song melody with different vocable lyrics; this pattern is also like bird songs.
      While this melody does seem like an imitation of the bird’s song, it could also be inspired by the robin’s way of moving, in which it will pause while listening and looking for worms, then hop and run a short distance
      (<aac:ref type="video" href="#vid:robin-hopping" />).

    <h1>Movements</h1>
    <p>
    In the Robin Dance participants line up with all the men first followed by the women and move in a counterclockwise circle.
    First dancers face the center and shuffle sideways to their right, stepping first with the right foot then in the next step bringing the left foot over next to it.
    At the first repeat of each song (<em>Yo:ho: yo: ...</em>) the dancers turn around to face outwards, and then continue the same motions but reversed: now they step to their left with their left foot and bring the right foot next to it.
    In the last song, when the syncopations shift the beat by an eighth note, the dancers match this by taking two quick eighth-note steps on the accented <em>noheyah</em> and then continuing with quarter-note steps on the beats stressed by the melody.
    <!-- TODO show -->
    Perhaps these motions, like the melody, were inspired by the hopping and running of the robin.
