    Robin Dance is sung to honor the robin, especially at the start of spring, though it can be sung throughout the year.
    The song acknowledges and thanks the robin as a harbinger of spring after the long winter: as Bill says, <q>We’re honoring the robin, so we welcome it back</q>

    <h1>Story</h1>
    <p>
    According to Seneca oral tradition, the Robin Dance was a gift to the people from the robin, and the robin was originally a human boy.
    That boy went out into the woods with his uncle on a vision quest, and while he was fasting and waiting for a vision, he grew ill and began to waste away.
    His uncle found him on the point of death, with his chest painted red, but the boy begged to wait another day.
    When the uncle returned the last time, he found a bird who told him,
    <q>I am your nephew. I am <em class="seneca">jö:yaik</em>,</q> the robin, and from now on he would be the sign that spring was returning.
    He gave the people his songs as a way of honoring him and the promise of spring.

    <p>
    The Seneca Robin Dance is evidence of a long, close relationship between humans and robins in this region, which Western science confirms.
    The American robin (<em class="latin">Turdus migratorius</em>) already lived all across North America when humans first arrived, but robins seem to have lived close by humans since
    <aac:citation key="CornellBirds:Robin" />.
    They prefer to hunt in grassy, open areas with plenty of sunlight, and so they thrive in human-settled landscapes or at the <q>woods’ edge</q>.
    In recent times scientists robin populations have been documented to expand following patterns of human settlement
    <aac:citation key="CornellBirds:Robin" />.
    Robins show awareness of people and their habits: city robins allow people to come much closer to them than their country cousins do, and they are less frightened of people walking on paths without looking at them, possibly because they have learned the predictable pattern that people tend to stay on paths
    <aac:citation key="Eason:RobinFlight" />.
    Human behavior shapes robin behavior: robins sing earlier in the morning when there is more light pollution
    <aac:citation key="Miller:RobinLightPollution" />,
    and robins in different cities show differing levels of fear toward humans 
    based on cultural differences in how humans there treat birds
    <aac:citation key="ClucasMarzluff:UrbanBirdAttitudes" />.
    </p>
    <p>
    Robins’ close proximity to humans, their easily identifiable song, and their seasonal return, make them one of the better-known birds even to urban settlers who do not otherwise pay much attention to birds.
    <q>Because the species is so widespread, virtually all North Americans hear, and are warmed by, the lovely melody of the robin during the spring and summer, although many people do not recognize its song as such.
      Those who do, however, widely regard the early migrating American robin to be  a longed-for harbinger of springtime and warmer weather, because this bird often arrives at the northern parts of its range and sings while there is still snow on the ground</q>
    <aac:citation key="GaleScience:Robins" />.
    </p>
    <p>
    The difference between the common folkloric ideas of robins and the Seneca Robin Dance is that Seneca people and their ancestors have lived side-by-side with this species of bird in this territory for thousands of years, and the song was developed and preserved through oral tradition as a sign of their close relationship.
    One evidence of that intimacy with robins could be the way the robin in the Seneca story was originally a human boy. 
    It is not clear whether this was the first robin, or whether the robins perhaps chose this boy as an intermediary and transformed him into one of them.
    Either way the story emphasizes kinship with the robin, who shares something beneficial with humankind.

      <h2>Relationship and Reciprocity</h2>
      <p>
      The story of Robin Dance recalls several other Seneca stories in which non-human beings share songs or dances with people.
      Often they come through an intermediary person who was isolated and separate from the community.
      Bear Dance was a gift from the bears, just as Changing Rib came from the frogs, and the Green Corn songs, from the Three Sisters.
      </p>
      <p>
      The songs of Changing Rib Ceremony were brought by a young man who had left his own village for his wife and then had to leave his wife’s village as well; in that in-between space of not belonging anywhere, he found himself in a marsh full of singing frogs, who gave him their songs to use as medicine when he went back to his community.
      </p>
      <p>
      The story of Bear Dance is similar: an orphaned child was abandoned in the forest and taken in by a mother bear, who taught him the ways of the bear.
      Once he reached adulthood, she taught him songs that he could use when he returned to bring healing to his people.
      </p>
      <p>
      According to <em class="seneca">Gáíwi:yo:h’</em>, the teachings of Handsome Lake, in the late eighteenth-century days of that Seneca prophet the people’s sin was so bad that even <em class="seneca">Jöhéhgöh</em>, the Three Sisters of corn, beans, and squash, wanted to leave the land, but Sganyodaiyo’ (Handsome Lake) begged them to stay.
      They agreed to remain on the condition that the people would sing special songs for them in their ceremonies, which they taught to Sganyodaiyo’ and are still sung in the Green Corn Ceremony today.
      </p>
      <p>
      In all these cases, non-human beings chose an intermediary who was at the margins of the human community and in what anthropologists would call a <em>liminal</em> or threshold state: lost in the woods (Bear and Changing Rib), at a time of community crisis (Green Corn), or on a vision quest (Robin).
      The songs were not a human’s artistic creation, but a gift from these beings to be used for a specific purpose.
      The beings gave people a way to relate to them and to draw on their power for the good of the human community.
      </p>
      <p>
      In a way this pattern recalls the way Haudenosaunee people treated Euro-Americans in the treaties of the early colonial era.
      The Haudenosaunee Confederacy was willing to treat with specific ambassadors from the colonial community who they knew and recognized, and who had enough knowledge of their language and culture, and enough humility, that the Native leaders believed they could communicate with them
      <aac:citationList>
      <aac:citation key="Richter:FacingEast" pages="129–150" />
      <aac:citation key="Richter:Ordeal" />
      <aac:citation key="Fenton:GreatLaw" />
      </aac:citationList>
      The Euro-Americans did not know how to relate to Native people, so the confederacy chiefs provided protocols for them to follow.
      They adapted the Condolence Council that they had used to mourn fallen chiefs and effectively gave it to the colonial ambassadors as the proper way to relate to them.
      They gave them the concept of the Covenant Chain, the imagery of the Tree of Peace, the Two-Row Wampum, and other cultural elements to enable a relationship on terms both sides could accept.
      Their diplomacy between <em class="seneca">ögwé’ö:weh</em> Original People (Natives) and Euro-Americans was built on the model of relationships between humans and their non-human relatives like corn and the robin.
      </p>
      <p>
      Robin Dance, like other Earth Songs, provides a way for Seneca people to renew reciprocal relationships with the non-human world and with each other.
      The dance also provides a way for Seneca people to teach those non-Native neighbors who will listen, how to relate to them and to the natural world in a healthy way.
      Neither European culture nor Christianity provided people like Andrew’s Anglo-German ancestors with ways to recognize and establish relationships with the specific birds, animals, and plants of northeastern America.
      Robins do not appear in the Biblical psalms or the Christian liturgy.
      Early modern Roman Catholics did have some traditional support for treating Creation as a <q>book of nature</q> in which they could read lessons of God’s wisdom and goodness reflected in his creatures, such as the influential sixteenth-century writings of the Spanish Fray Luis de Granada
      <aac:citationList>
      <aac:citation key="LuisdeGranada:Simbolo" />
      <aac:citation key="Cashner:HearingFaith" pages="44–47" />
      </aac:citationList>.
      But the Protestants did not cultivate a similar curiosity toward the natural world and tended instead to emphasize God’s mandate to subdue and cultivate it.

      For Andrew, learning to sing Robin Dance has opened his eyes to the robins hopping around absolutely everywhere in Rochester, including a family nesting under the eave of his neighbor’s house and daily gathering food for their babies in his yard.
      Watching a robin perched high up on a dead branch of a maple tree, sheltered from rain under the shelter of overhanging leaves, singing its song with the same beat and gestures as the Seneca Robin Dance, I (Andrew) was grateful for the gift that the Seneca people have given me, a way to recognize and relate to my closest neighbor among the birds.

    <h1>Songs</h1>
    <p>
    The Allegany Singers recorded six Robin Dance songs in 2002
    (<aac:ref type="video" href="#vid:robin-score" />).
    In contrast to <a class="internal" href="quiver.html">Standing Quiver</a> and <a class="internal" href="moccasin.html">Old Moccasin Dance</a>, where one song can differ widely from the next, these Robin Dance songs sound more like variations on a single theme.

    <p>
    The set begins with a slow introduction in free time, started by the lead singer and continued by the whole group.
    This introduction outlines the basic outline of the melody that will recur in all the songs.
    All the songs follow the same outline, which includes a smaller collection of pitches than some other songs
    (<aac:ref type="table" href="#tab:robin-pitches" />): 
    just <em>do</em>, <em>re</em>, <em>mi</em>, and <em>sol</em> or <em>la</em> (songs 5 and 6 include both).
    Though under Western training Andrew thinks of these pitches as belonging to a scale starting on E, the songs actually emphasize B much more strongly, both by stress and by including both the lower and higher B.
    When Robin Dance is sung in a reverberant space like the cookhouse used for both 2002 and 2022 Allegany Singers recordings, the repetition of only four or five notes, in repeated, short phrases with brief rests between, greatly reinforces the overtones resonating in the room to where Andrew found he could clearly hear the melody an octave and sometimes even two octaves higher resounding in the space.
    </p>
    <xi:include href="../tables/robin-pitches.xhtml" />
    <p>
    The melody in song 1 begins with repeated long one-beat notes (quarter notes as transcribed) on <em>yo:ho</em>, on <em>sol</em> (<aac:degree n="5" />), then moves down to a syncopated pattern on <em>mi–re</em>, followed by a dip down to low <em>sol</em> and back up to the middle register.
    There are three melodic phrases, and the second and third repeat the last portion of the first.
    This structure could be analyzed A-A'-A' or AB-B-B.
    </p>
    <p>
    Songs 2 and 3 vary the melody in song 1 in different ways: song 2 shortens the first phrase and alters one pitch (going down to <em>la</em> instead of <em>sol</em>).
    Song 3 expands the first phrase (from vocables of 11 syllables in song 1 to 16).
    </p>
    <p>
    Layout out the melodies graphically to show the repeating portions demonstrates that in each song the second and later phrases start by repeating the latter portion of the first phrase.
    Songs 4, 5, and 6 all have slightly different patterns of phrasing and repeated motives: song 4 could be labeled A-BC-BC, song 5 as A-BC-C'C, and song 6 as A-B-C-B.
    What all the songs have in common is that the subsequent phrases all repeat and vary some element of the preceding phrases.
    The effect of these partial repetitions and variations, especially with the frequent rests between phrases, seems to Andrew to create an effect similar to listening to repeating fragments of birdsong.
    </p>
    <p>
    The rhythmic patterns feature increasingly complex syncopation over a steady, moderate water-drum and horn-rattle beat at 100 beats per minute.
    The initial eighth-quarter-eighth syncopation in songs 1 and 2 expands in songs 3 and 4 into what sounds (to Andrew) like mixed meter, switching between groups of 2 and 3 eighth notes.
    In song 4, these syncopations actually shift the sense of pulse by an eighth note, so that the vocable <em>ya:ne</em> sounds like it is on the beat even though it does not actually coincide with the beats played on drum and rattle.
    The last song is the most syncopated, and here the rattle and drum players actually shift their beat to match with the melody, by adding a third eighth-note subdivision in between beat accents.

      <h2>Imitating Robin’s Song?</h2>
      <p>
      Could the Robin Dance songs have been created by imitating the song of the actual bird?
      Robin songs feature three or more repeated chirrups at a certain pace,
      about 100 beats per minute
      (<aac:ref type="video" href="#vid:robin-song" />).
      The first two chirrups stay fairly constant in timing and pitch across the sung.
      When robins vary the song it is usually in the <q>syllables</q> after that (discrete vocalizations that are part of a larger song), so that for example there might be four vocalizations and the last one would have a different type of contour.
      </p>
      <figure class="video" id="vid:robin-song">
        <iframe class="manual-size" height="300" width="640" src="https://macaulaylibrary.org/asset/230039991/embed"></iframe>
        <figCaption>Song of an American robin in the Conewango Swamp Wildlife Management Area, between the Cattaraugus and Allegany Territories of the Seneca Nation, near Randolph, NY (recorded by Andrew Spencer, courtesy of the Cornell Ornithology Lab, Macaulay Library)</figCaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
      The Seneca dance songs also being with a repeated high-pitch call, <em>Yoh hoh yo:h</em>, at a similar pace to the bird’s, and in both of the Allegany Singers’ recordings, settles into a steady beat at 100 beats per minute
      (<aac:ref type="video" href="#vid:robin-coldspring" />
      <aac:ref type="video" href="#vid:robin-score"> and </aac:ref>).
      The rest of the Seneca melody is built of short, repetitive phrases of just a few notes each.
      That these phrases come after the high-pitch call may imitate the pattern in which the robin’s song variations happen after the first three chirrups.
      Moreover, the different Robin Dance songs are really variations on one song melody with different vocable lyrics; this pattern is also like bird songs.
      While this melody does seem like an imitation of the bird’s song, it could also be inspired by the robin’s way of moving, in which it will pause while listening and looking for worms, then hop and run a short distance
      (<aac:ref type="video" href="#vid:robin-hopping" />).

    <h1>Movements</h1>
    <p>
    In the Robin Dance participants line up with all the men first followed by the women and move in a counterclockwise circle.
    First dancers face the center and shuffle sideways to their right, stepping first with the right foot then in the next step bringing the left foot over next to it.
    At the first repeat of each song (<em>Yo:ho: yo: ...</em>) the dancers turn around to face outwards, and then continue the same motions but reversed: now they step to their left with their left foot and bring the right foot next to it.
    In the last song, when the syncopations shift the beat by an eighth note, the dancers match this by taking two quick eighth-note steps on the accented <em>noheyah</em> and then continuing with quarter-note steps on the beats stressed by the melody.
    Perhaps these motions, like the melody, were inspired by the hopping and running of the robin.
