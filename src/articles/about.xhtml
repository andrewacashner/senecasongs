    <h1>Technology and Design</h1>
    <p>
    This project was created and published using a digital authoring system created by Andrew Cashner and available on <a href="https://github.com/andrewacashner">GitHub</a>.
    The text was written in an extension of XHTML that enables automatic citation and bibliography generation as well as automatic numbering and cross-referencing for tables, examples, and diagrams.
    The source files were converted using XSLT to HTML for web display and PDF, via LaTeX, for the printable PDF.
    The system uses LaTeX's own citation and referencing systems in the print backend (BibLaTeX and Biber) but provides its own for the web backend.
    Custom CSS stylesheets determined the layout and style of the website and custom LaTeX classes and packages styled the print version.
    </p>
    <p>
    Larger music examples were created in Dorico, while small, inline music clips were rendered with Lilypond.
    The main text font is EB Garamond, and section headings are in Venturis ADF Goth Titling and Venturis Sans ADF (all available free of license).
    Unless indicated otherwise, all photos and videos were created by Andrew Cashner for this project, using Final Cut Pro for editing video and Logic Pro for audio.
