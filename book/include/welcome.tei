<foreign lang="see">Nya:wëh sgë:nö’</foreign> (Greetings, I am thankful that you are well).
This site creates a space for sharing traditional music and dance of the Onöndowa’ga:’ (Seneca) Nation, one of the Six Nations of the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) Confederacy.
The site will feature video and audio recordings of Seneca Earth Songs (<foreign lang="see">yöëdza’ge:ka:’ gaë:nö’shö’</foreign>) together with traditional teaching and historical information.
For a full description of the project's goals, see <ref target="about.tei">the About page</ref>.

This project is a collaboration between Andrew Cashner, PhD, musician and musicologist at the University of Rochester, and Bill Crouse, Sr., Seneca faithkeeper and singer.
Please check back as we are building this site and <ref target="mailto:andrew.cashner@rochester.edu">get in touch</ref> if you would like to offer help or feedback.
