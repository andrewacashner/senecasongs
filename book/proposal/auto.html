<cite>Songs at the Woods Edge: The Earth Songs of the Seneca Nation</cite> is a digital-humanities project on the subject of the traditional social-dance songs of the Onöndowa’ga:’ people. The project is a collaboration between Seneca singer and faithkeeper Bill Crouse, Sr., and musicologist Andrew Cashner, PhD, of the University of Rochester.
</p>
<p>
The original inhabitants of the land now occupied by western New York, the Senecas are one of the Six Nations of the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) Confederacy. Traditional Seneca music is primarily vocal, supported by water drum and rattle, and usually combined with dance; the songs are divided into ceremonial and social functions. Ceremonial songs hold sacred power as part of longhouse ceremonies including healing rituals; they are closed to non-Senecas and many are even kept private within the Seneca community, reserved only for those who need them. Social songs, by contrast, are shared openly.
</p>
<p>
Known as Earth Songs (<em>yöëdza’ge:ka:’ gaë:nö’shö’</em>), these songs have been used for centuries to build reciprocal relationships within the Seneca community and with outsiders. The earliest European interlopers in Seneca country report being greeted at the woods’ edge with songs. At Ganondagan, the Seneca Arts and Culture Center near Victor, New York, visitors pass through an entryway designed around the traditional woods’-edge greeting to hear regular presentations of Earth Songs by Seneca singers like Bill Crouse. These presentations create a space like the woods’-edge clearing of earlier days in which to share Seneca teachings and values with outsiders. To sing at the woods’ edge means to stand at the boundary between indigenous traditional knowledge and modern experience under colonization, and between Seneca communities and Euro-American ones. As an ancient oral tradition that practitioners are constantly finding new ways to employ to meet present needs, the Earth Songs sung in that space connect history and tradition, memory and creativity.
</p>
<p>
Working together with Bill Crouse and other Seneca practitioners, this project will present Seneca Earth Songs to the academic community and general public for the first time accurately, sensitively, and on Seneca terms. Through a website and digital book of public scholarship, the project will present high-quality videos of the songs and dances with information about the songs’ origins, structure, and significance. It will draw on Bill Crouse’s expertise as a practitioner of the oral tradition, and Andrew Cashner’s archival research into historic accounts of Seneca dance from the Jesuit Relations through Lewis Henry Morgan and William Fenton.

Relationship to Existing Studies
</h2>
<p>
This study aims to address a lack of trustworthy, in-depth resources for learning about this type of Native American music. According to Peter Jemison, recently retired director of Ganondagan, the cultural center staff were flooded in the last two years by requests from educators for information on how to include Native culture in their curricula. <!-- Jemison source --> For Haudenosaunee and Seneca music, though, there are few reliable sources available. In the first scholarly description of Haudenosaunee dance (based on Seneca sources), Lewis Henry Morgan wrote in 1851 that the dances <q>contain within themselves a picture and a realization of Indian life,</q> to the extent that when the dance <q>loses its attractions, they will cease to be Indians</q> <span class="citation" data-cites="Morgan:League">(Morgan 1851, 261, 263)</span>. Morgan viewed the dances as static relics of a traditional past that Native people would have to surrender in the face of progressive <q>civilization.</q> Twentieth-century ethnographers William Fenton and Gertrude Kurath made no distinction between privileged ceremonial songs and social-dance songs, and as a result their books are full of information that Seneca faithkeepers today do not want to share with the public—not to mention the inaccuracies and non-indigenous categories of their analyses <span class="citation" data-cites="Fenton:GreatLaw FentonKurath:EagleDance Kurath:IroquoisMusic Caldwell:Kurath McCarthy:Iroquoianist">(Fenton 1998; Fenton and Kurath 1953; Kurath 1964; Caldwell 2008; McCarthy 2008)</span>.
</p>
<p>
The proposed project differs from these previous studies because it focuses on music that Seneca people are actually willing to share, and builds on the way they are already using this music to build intercultural relationships. The methodology follows the model of recent collaborative work between non-Native scholars and Native experts, such as Beverley Diamond’s excellent though brief introduction to Haudenosaunee music <span class="citation" data-cites="Diamond:NativeAmericanNortheast">(Diamond 2008)</span> and with a growing literature that emphasizes the modernity and creativity of Native music as a contemporary practice <span class="citation" data-cites="Browner:Heartbeat Browner:FirstNations LevineRobinson:MusicModernity">(Browner 2002; Browner 2009; Levine and Robinson 2019)</span>. This project has a more historical focus than those, however, as it combines ethnographic fieldwork with archival research, including seeking out indigenous perspectives on the archival documents. Even the best historical studies of early American music that focus on interactions with Native people are based on on Euro-American documents and do not incorporate traditional indigenous knowledge and oral tradition <span class="citation" data-cites="Goodman:IndianPsalmody Eyerly:Moravian">(Goodman 2012; Eyerly 2020)</span>. No history of American music can claim coherence without including the music of indigenous Americans, and no attempt at inclusion can succeed without the collaboration of practitioners of the oral traditions.

<h2>
Benefit to Scholars and the Public
</h2>
<p>
This project will benefit humanities scholars, educators, and members of the public by providing them with reliable information on Native American music. The knowledge shared through this project will help all of us to gain a deeper understanding of the land we share. Some indigenous people may deepen their connection to their own traditions; non-indigenous people will be better equipped to build relationships with Native American communities. The interlinked nature of a website is well suited to the relational and participatory character of the Earth Songs and the way they are shared in Seneca communities. The digital format will allow the book/website to be freely accessible to a wide public audience.
