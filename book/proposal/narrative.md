# Significance and Contribution

:::: {#overview}
*Songs at the Woods Edge: The Earth Songs of the Seneca Nation* is a
digital-humanities project on the subject of the traditional social-dance
songs of the Onöndowa’ga:’ people.
The project is a collaboration between Seneca singer and faithkeeper Bill
Crouse, Sr., and musicologist Andrew Cashner, PhD, of the University of
Rochester.

The original inhabitants of the land now occupied by western New York, the
Senecas are one of the Six Nations of the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois)
Confederacy.
Traditional Seneca music is primarily vocal, supported by water drum and
rattle, and usually combined with dance; the songs are divided into ceremonial
and social functions.
Ceremonial songs hold sacred power as part of longhouse ceremonies including
healing rituals; they are closed to non-Senecas and many are even kept private
within the Seneca community, reserved only for those who need them.
Social songs, by contrast, are shared openly.

Known as Earth Songs (*yöëdza’ge:ka:’ gaë:nö’shö’*), these songs have been
used for centuries to build reciprocal relationships within the Seneca
community and with outsiders.
The earliest European interlopers in Seneca country report being
greeted at the woods' edge with songs.
At Ganondagan, the Seneca Arts and Culture Center near Victor, New York,
visitors pass through an entryway designed around the traditional woods'-edge
greeting to hear regular presentations of Earth Songs by Seneca singers like
Bill Crouse.
These presentations create a space like the woods'-edge clearing of earlier
days in which to share Seneca teachings and values with outsiders.
To sing at the woods' edge means to stand at the boundary between indigenous
traditional knowledge and modern experience under colonization, and between
Seneca communities and Euro-American ones.
As an ancient oral tradition that practitioners are constantly finding new
ways to employ to meet present needs, the Earth Songs sung in that space
connect history and tradition, memory and creativity.

Working together with Bill Crouse and other Seneca practitioners, this project
will present Seneca Earth Songs to the academic community and general public
for the first time accurately, sensitively, and on Seneca terms.
Through a website and digital book of public scholarship, the project will
present high-quality videos of the songs and dances with information about the
songs' origins, structure, and significance.
It will draw on Bill Crouse's expertise as a practitioner of the oral
tradition, and Andrew Cashner's archival research into historic accounts of
Seneca dance from the Jesuit Relations through Lewis Henry Morgan and William
Fenton.

## Relationship to Existing Studies

This study aims to address a lack of trustworthy, in-depth resources for
learning about this type of Native American music.
According to Peter Jemison, recently retired director of Ganondagan, the
cultural center staff were flooded in the last two years by requests from
educators for information on how to include Native culture in their curricula. 
<!-- Jemison source -->
For Haudenosaunee and Seneca music, though, there are few reliable sources
available.
In the first scholarly description of Haudenosaunee dance (based on Seneca
sources), Lewis Henry Morgan wrote in 1851 that the dances "contain within
themselves a picture and a realization of Indian life," to the extent that
when the dance "loses its attractions, they will cease to be Indians"
[@Morgan:League, 261, 263].
Morgan viewed the dances as static relics of a traditional past that Native
people would have to surrender in the face of progressive "civilization."
Twentieth-century ethnographers William Fenton and Gertrude Kurath made no
distinction between privileged ceremonial songs and social-dance songs, and as
a result their books are full of information that Seneca faithkeepers today do
not want to share with the public—not to mention the inaccuracies and
non-indigenous categories of their analyses
[@Fenton:GreatLaw; 
@FentonKurath:EagleDance; 
@Kurath:IroquoisMusic; 
@Caldwell:Kurath;
@McCarthy:Iroquoianist].

The proposed project differs from these previous studies because it focuses on
music that Seneca people are actually willing to share, and builds on the way
they are already using this music to build intercultural relationships.
The methodology follows the model of recent collaborative work between
non-Native scholars and Native experts, such as Beverley Diamond's excellent
though brief introduction to Haudenosaunee music 
[@Diamond:NativeAmericanNortheast]
and with a growing literature that emphasizes the modernity and creativity of
Native music as a contemporary practice
[@Browner:Heartbeat;
@Browner:FirstNations;
@LevineRobinson:MusicModernity]
This project has a more historical focus than those, however, as it combines
ethnographic fieldwork with archival research, including seeking out
indigenous perspectives on the archival documents.
Even the best historical studies of early American music that focus on
interactions with Native people are based on on Euro-American documents and do
not incorporate traditional indigenous knowledge and oral tradition 
[@Goodman:IndianPsalmody;
@Eyerly:Moravian].
No history of American music can claim coherence without including the music
of indigenous Americans, and no attempt at inclusion can succeed without the
collaboration of practitioners of the oral traditions.

## Benefit to Scholars and the Public

This project will benefit humanities scholars, educators, and members of the
public by providing them with reliable information on Native American music.
The knowledge shared through this project will help all of us to gain a deeper
understanding of the land we share.
Some indigenous people may deepen their connection to their own traditions;
non-indigenous people will be better equipped to build relationships with
Native American communities.
The interlinked nature of a website is well suited to the relational and
participatory character of the Earth Songs and the way they are shared in
Seneca communities.
The digital format will allow the book/website to be freely accessible to a
wide public audience.
