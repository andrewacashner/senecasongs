        The Standing Quiver dance is always the first dance whenever Earth Songs are sung.
        It comes from the way Seneca villages would send out groups of men for hunting or combat.
        One leader would take his arrow and drive it into the ground.
        As he went around the village enlisting other men, they would drive their arrows in next to the leaders, resulting in a <q>standing quiver</q>.
        In the same way then, this dance calls everyone in the community to gather together and join in the dancing.
        </p>
        <p>
        The music imitates the actions: the leader calls out and the other singers respond.
        Sometimes their melody is the same as the leader's but more often there are two separate phrases, like a question and an answer.
        The singers and dancers maintain a steady, walking beat, which distinguishes this dance as a kind of stomp dance.
        The first song features short call-and-response pairs, each repeated multiple times.
        The same pattern continues in the other songs but the phrases tend to get longer as the song continues.
        </p>
        <p>
        According to oral tradition, originally each singer had his own song in this dance, reflecting his own style and personality.
        Hearing the Standing Quiver Dance now we can imagine a portrait of a whole team of hunters or warriors setting out, proud of themselves and enthusiastic to start their adventure together.
        </p>
        <p>
        The story about Standing Quiver mirrors the way that Bill was taught to learn long sets of songs.
        His teachers told him to picture a line of people coming before him, each to sing a different song.
        So when he thought of each new song in his mind, he pictures the next person coming forward.
        There is a close link, then, between memory and relationship, tradition and community.

          <p>
          So think about those guys paddling along, wearing their good clothes...
          maybe they’re going to trade somewhere, or going somewhere; maybe they're
          dressed for war—maybe that’s what they call it—but as they’re going
          along, they’re singing this.
          <strong>How cool is it to have history like that?</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
          I think about music and ceremony and social dance that it’s a miracle
          that we have anything, because I know a lot of tribes don’t have that.
          [...]
          So to me it seems that all the stuff that happened in our past, 
          <strong>no matter what happened, they kept singing.</strong>
          [...]
          There was times when they didn't feel like singing and dancing, you
          know, but they kept going, and they kept it going. 
          They kept that ceremonial circle going.
          </p>
          <p>
          So to us, we look at it not as a job but as a responsibility, I guess,
          to pass it on, ’cause they didn’t let it go, so there’s a reason that
          they did that.
          And now, when I do that and sing that and everybody dances that, it’s
          like, <strong>it’s strong: we’re still here, and we celebrate that.</strong>
          So that’s what music is about for us.

          As with all Seneca social dances, the participants dance while singers sing a set of songs specific to that dance, accompanied with instruments.
          The lead singer selects which songs to include based on the time available and personal preference.
          In general for Seneca social dances, most songs last between one and two minutes, and it is common to select between ten and fifteen songs, making a full dance of fifteen minutes or more.
          In the version of Standing Quiver recorded by the Allegany Singers in 2002, Kyle Dowdy selected ten songs.
          The transcription is an interpretation of one person’s hearing of this recording.
          </p>
          <p>
          <em class="seneca">Ga’da:šo:t</em> always begins with the first song in that recording.
          The leader and singers sing short phrases in a call-and-response (or antiphonal) pattern:
          <em>ah</em>/<em>hwih</em>, 
          <em>eyo’</em>/<em>hwe</em>, 
          <em>ahe’</em>/<em>ahe’</em>, 
          <em>wiha’</em>/<em>wiha’</em>, 
          <em>ë-ë’</em>/<em>ë-ë’</em>, 
          <em>hayo’/hayo’</em>.
          These are sung first on a single pitch (approximately <aac:pitch pname="A" oct="4" /> in this recording), then expanding the pitches a half-step below and above.
          The singers are accompanied with a <em class="seneca">ga’sä:dö’</em> (frame drum) at a slow walking tempo.
          The alternation between leader and singers might be heard as pairs of phrases that suggest a larger metrical group (e.g., 2/4).
          The song closes with a high-pitched exclamation, as does every song in this dance.
          </p>
          <p>
          After this introductory song, the remaining songs follow the pattern of song 2.
          The call-and-response pattern continues, now with longer phrases.
          The singers do not repeat the leader’s phrase but sing a separate response.
          The melody follows an ABA' form: a first antiphonal phrase, repeated several times; followed by a contrasting phrase, usually with a higher pitch center; closing with a third phrase that ends the same way as the first one did.
          (This might be compared to a European rounded binary form.)
          In song 2, the A phrase centers on the pitch A; the B phrase, on the pitch B; and then the A' phrase returns to A.
          That whole section is then repeated; the second time the first phrase is usually repeated one less time than it was initially.
          Another way to think of it would be to say that the first A phrase is an introduction (as is often the case in other Seneca dances).
          </p>
          <p>
          There is a general pattern that the number of pitches used and the length of phrases tends to expand from one song to the next.
          Where song 1 featured three pitches (A, B<aac:fl />, G<aac:sh />) and two-beat call-and-response groups (1 + 1),
          song 2 features four pitches (A, B, C<aac:sh />, E) and four- and five-beat groups (A 2 + 2, B 2 + 2, A' 3 + 2).
          Song three features a different four pitches (A, B, D, E) and six-beat groups (3 + 3).
          The pattern does not continue exactly, as for example in song 6 when groups are shortened to 2 + 1, with four pitches.
          But in a way this only heightens the sense of progression when in the next song, which features phrases of six and eight beats, and includes six pitches (A, B, C<aac:na />, D, E, and F<aac:sh />).
          </p>
          <p>
          The total set of pitches is A, B<aac:fl />, B<aac:na />, C<aac:na />, C<aac:sh />, D, E, and F<aac:sh /> (<aac:pcset n="0 1 2 3 4 5 7 9" />).
          Most of the songs, though, emphasize A, B, C<aac:sh />, D, and E (<aac:pcset n="0 2 4 5 7" />).
          The tonal center throughout is on A as <aac:degree accid="sh" n="1" />.

          <h2>Words</h2>
          <p>
          As in other Seneca Earth Songs, most of the words are vocables.
          Though meaningless, they are always sung the same way and are an integral part of each songs.
          Standing Quiver also includes some Seneca-language words.

            In September 2022 the Allegany Singers recorded two different versions of the songs: the first <a href="#quiver-coldspring-1">(above)</a> was the version sung by Bill Crouse, based on continuous oral tradition. 
            The second was an alternate version sung by Jake George, who though much younger than Bill, has studied earlier recordings by some of his relatives, and based this new/old version on the way they sang it.

        The dance follows the story of a men recruiting a band to go out traveling from the village.
        The leader begins dancing with a shuffle step in a counterclockwise circle, and he is followed by pairs of men and women.
        As Bill explains, <q>even though the women aren’t going, they’re supporting their men</q>.
        </p>
        <p>
        Each song has an ABA' structure with an initial call-and-response, then a section with a higher pitch, and then a modified repeat of the opening phrase. 
        When the higher-pitched section begins, the dancers turn and face the middle.
