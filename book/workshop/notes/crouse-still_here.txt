What it’s talking about, *hodigawenöje*, is that they’re paddling along, and
then they’re moving along like that.
So you think about those same guys, traveling by boat now, and they’re
paddling their canoes, and they're going along.
It says, "they've got on their good clothes" and "they're making a great
noise."
What that implies is that they're looking good, and they're sounding good.
So I think they're singing that. 
So think about those guys paddling along, wearing their good clothes...
maybe they're going to trade somewhere, or going somewhere; maybe they're
dressed for war---maybe that's what they call it---but as they're going along,
they're singing this.
So how cool is it to have history like that?

And the thing to me---you know, I think about music, and I think about
ceremony, of course, and social dance, even, that it's a miracle that we have
anything, because I know a lot of tribes and a lot of people around
us---tribal groups---don't have that.
A lot of tribal groups don't have their language.
So to me it seems that all the stuff that happened in our past,
no matter what happened, they kept singing.

And I know, for a fact, 'cause I grew up through the Kinzua era, okay, as a
little kid.
That was going on when I was a baby, and I grew up through that, I saw that. 
There was times when they didn't feel like singing and dancing, you know, but
they kept going, and they kept it going. They kept that ceremonial circle going.
And you know, it's like, wow.

So to us, it's---we look at it not as a job but as a responsibility, I guess,
to pass it on, 'cause they didn't let it go, so there's a reason that they
did that.
And now, you know, when I do that like I said and sing that and everybody
dances that, it's like, it's strong: we're still here, and we celebrate that.
So that's what music is about for us.
