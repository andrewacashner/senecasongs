          I live with my wife and children in Rochester, New York, just west
          of the Genesee River on land that President George Washington
          guaranteed forever to the Seneca Nation in the Candandaigua Treaty
          of 1794.
          </p>

          I teach and research music at the University of Rochester, and I am
          a pianist, singer, composer, and ensemble director.
          I lead the worship and creative arts ministry at New Hope Free
          Methodist Church in Rochester.

          I am the descendant, probably, of German and English ancestors who
          came to the United States to farm Native land in Pennsylvania, Ohio,
          and Kentucky.
          I grew up in Richmond, Indiana, and studied piano performance at
          Lawrence University in Wisconsin and New England Conservatory in
          Boston.
          I have worked as a church musician for many years in many types of
          Christian churches, and I studied sacred music and organ performance
          at the University of Notre Dame.
          I received the PhD in the history and theory of music from the
          University of Chicago in 2015.

          My doctoral research and first publications all concerned music as
          religious devotion in the Spanish Empire.
          My research interests include the history and theology of Christian
          worship, colonial societies, popular song in religious devotion,
          musical representations of racial difference, computer science and
          the history of science, and music history pedagogy.
