        <h1>Welcome to the Woods’ Edge</h1>
        <p>
        Nya:wëh sgë:nö’! Greetings, and we give thanks that you are
        well.

        Since the earliest memories that have been handed down to us, the
        woods’ edge was a meeting place between communities in the forests of
        eastern North America.
        Members of the Six Nations of the Hodinöhšö:ni:h (Iroquois)
        Confederacy greeted newcomers who came to their villages through the
        woods by a ceremony of songs and actions at the edge of the clearing.
        These Indigenous communities used songs as a way to bring new people
        into their circle, whether they were members of other Native nations
        or Euro-American colonizers and settlers.</p>
        <p>For the Onöndowa’ga:’ (Seneca) people, the Keepers of the Western
        Door for the Hodinöhšö:ni:h Confederacy, the traditional social dance
        songs known as Earth Songs have always served a special role in
        building community and extending welcome to outsiders.
        Many types of Onöndowa’ga:’ songs serve ceremonial purposes and are
        invested with sacred power that would be dangerous and inappropriate
        to share; knowledge of these songs is privileged and protected even
        within Seneca communities.
        But the Earth Songs are open to everyone: Seneca singers share them
        frequently at public events as a way of promoting Indigenous values
        and inviting conversations across boundaries.
        This website provides a clearing at the woods’ edge where anyone,
        Native or non-Native, can gather who wants to connect with the Seneca
        Nation and its traditions.

      This work was completed on the territory of the Seneca Nation of
      Indians and other locations, including Rochester, New York, that occupy
      the ancestral territory of the Onöndowa’ga:’ (Seneca) Nation, one of the
      Six Nations of the Hodinöhšö:ni:h (Iroquois) Confederacy.
