        This research project, <cite>Songs at the Woods’ Edge: The Earth Songs
          of the Seneca Nation</cite>, is a collaboration with with Bill
        Crouse, Sr., the renowned Seneca master musician and faithkeeper,
        focused on the traditional repertoire of Onöndowa’ga:’ (Seneca) social
        dance songs, also known as earth songs.
        We envision two main outputs: (1) a co-authored book of public
        scholarship and (2) a website featuring high-quality videos of
        performances of the songs and dances and teaching about them.
        Both the book and the website will provide the first in-depth,
        reliable guide to this vital aspect of Haudenosaunee (Iroquois)
        culture for scholars, educators, and the public, presented from an
        indigenous perspective and according to indigenous values.  
        The book will focus on these social dance songs as a living tradition,
        drawing on Bill Crouse’s expertise as a practitioner of the oral
        tradition; and as a historic one, drawing on my archival research in
        Lewis Henry Morgan’s papers and other sources that document these
        songs in the earliest intercultural encounters. 
        </p>
        <p>
        The central concept of the book comes from the historic Seneca
        practice of the <q>Woods’-Edge Greeting</q>, which was a way of
        welcoming outsiders into the village and played an important role both
        in the functioning of the Haudenosaunee League government and in
        treaty negotiations with Euro-Americans 
        <a href="#Richter:Ordeal">(Richter 1992)</a>.
        Seneca musicians are still using these songs to create a meeting space
        for building reciprocal relationships between Native and non-Native
        people, as well as helping Seneca people reconnect with their own
        heritage.
        In fact, the entryway to Ganondagan, the Seneca Cultural Center near
        Victor, is designed around the traditional Woods’-Edge Greeting, and
        Bill Crouse regularly presents social songs there in events that are
        free and open to the public, using the songs as a way to teach
        traditional Onöndowa’ga:’ values and to highlight the resiliency and
        vibrancy of Seneca culture today.
        We intend for the book and website, likewise, to stand in the clearing
        at the woods’ edge, using the earth songs to welcome anyone who wants
        to build a closer relationship to the original people of this land and
        their traditions.
        </p>
        <p>
        We envision five chapters for the book, with the first three based
        primarily on interviews with Bill Crouse and the last two based more
        on my historical research.
        The first chapter will focus on the songs’ relationship to the earth:
        we will explore the geographical places and environments in which the
        songs are performed today, and where they were sung across the
        ancestral Onöndowa’ga:’ territory currently occupied by western New
        York.
        This chapter will also pass on traditional teachings about the
        spiritual dimension of the songs as means of connecting people to the
        earth and to each other.
        The second chapter will go into detail about the musical structure and
        patterns of these songs, not imposing European analytical categories
        but helping readers understand indigenous ways of understanding
        singing and dance.
        The third chapter will discuss teaching and tradition, tracing
        genealogies of teachers and methods of oral transmission, and showing
        how the Seneca people kept these traditions alive despite many
        obstacles, from land dispossession and forced removal to boarding
        schools and the Kinzua dam tragedy.
        Moreover it will show how the younger generations of Onöndowa’ga:’
        musicians are still responding creatively to tradition and finding its
        relevance to their contemporary situation.
        </p>
        <p>
        Chapter four will trace the origin and history of the songs,
        connecting indigenous oral traditions with written archival documents
        that make it possible to trace these songs back to the first
        encounters with Europeans.
        This chapter will correct errors and fill in gaps in the small body of
        existing scholarship, and draw on previously unrecognized archival
        sources, seen through indigenous eyes.
        The final chapter will look at the earth songs within the context of a
        long history of intercultural exchange, preceding European encounter
        and continuing today, in which Haudenosaunee people have used songs at
        the woods’ edge to share their community with outsiders and build
        relationships with them based on mutual benefit.

        This project would meet a significant need for trustworthy information
        about Native American music in our region, provided with the authority
        and blessing of indigenous experts and their communities.
        Beverley Diamond’s introduction to Haudenosaunee music is sound but
        very brief, and it models the collaborative approach between
        non-Native scholars Native experts that we will be using
        <a href="#Diamond:NativeAmericanNortheast">(Diamond 2008)</a>.
        We hope that our work will be able to correct the serious errors and
        shortcomings in the few more detailed works of published scholarship
        on this topic.
        The first detailed description of Seneca social dances was written by
        Lewis Henry Morgan in his <cite>The League of the Haudenosaunee, or
          Iroquois</cite>, published here in Rochester in 1851, and based on
        his first-hand observations of Seneca practices with the help of
        Seneca informants
        <a href="#Morgan:League">(Morgan 1851)</a>.
        He describes dances as so central to Haudenosaunee culture that
        <q>they contain within themselves a picture and a realization of
          Indian life</q>, to the extent that when the dance <q>loses its
          attractions, they will cease to be Indians</q>
        <a href="#Morgan:League">(Morgan 1851: 261, 263)</a>.
        He later argues, however, that Native Americans will only be able to
        survive in <q>civilization</q> if they give up their traditional ways,
        and so his book is at once a tribute to indigenous culture and an
        instrument of its destruction.
        Morgan’s papers are preserved here at the University of Rochester, and
        despite his bias, the records contain some of the oldest detailed
        information about Seneca dance.
        Like many Euro-American observers before him, he observed many
        practices that he did not understand, but his descriptions may yield
        intelligible information to contemporary pracitioners like Bill
        Crouse.
        </p>

        In the twentieth century, William Fenton and Gertrude Kurath published
        ethnographic studies of Haudenosaunee dances and ceremonial songs
        which, though based on first-hand observation, were not sufficiently
        informed by insider perspectives or attuned to the priorities and
        values of the people they were observing.
        <!-- \Autocites{Fenton:GreatLaw}{Kurath:IroquoisMusic} -->
        Kurath is the only source for detailed study of the actual sound and
        structure of Haudenosaunee songs, but her taxonomies and speculative
        analysis are based on criteria foreign to indigenous teachings.
        In Fenton’s case, his work is actually considered by many Seneca
        people to be both offensive and factually wrong.
        He made ceremonial information public that was meant to be kept
        private, even within Haudenosaunee communities.
        Though his attempt to reconstruct the original ceremonies by which the
        Haudenosaunee League constituted itself was ultimately unsuccessful,
        Fenton nevertheless identified a large number of historical and
        archival sources that describe songs and dances still practiced today.
        As with Morgan, then, Fenton gathered much valuable information even
        if he made questionable use of it.
        Scrutiny of his published and manuscript writings together with an
        indigenous expert will make it possible to correct the published
        scholarly record and is likely to yield information about Seneca
        traditions that may have been lost over the years and could be of
        value to the Seneca Nation.
        In this sense the historical portion of this project will be an act of
        intellectual and cultural repatriation.

        This work extends my work on music and religious belief in colonial
        Latin America into a new part of the world, requiring a shift in
        methodology and a new ethical sensitivity with respect to indigenous
        peoples.

        I began this project with the support of a Humanities Center
        Fellowship in spring 2020. 
        Since then I have been developing relationships with people in the
        Seneca Nation and learning the Seneca language with Ja:no’s Bowen of
        the Allegany Territory Language Department.
        I have done most of the necessary background reading in primary and
        secondary sources and have begun working with archival sources in our
        own Rare Books and Special Collections relative to local Native
        American history.
        I have incorporated what I have been learning into my teaching, as I
        have included units on Haudenosaunee song in courses on music
        appreciation and music history, including hosting Bill Crouse as a
        guest teacher in spring 2021 and again this April.
        </p>
        <p>
        On campus I hope to draw on the resources of our Department of Audio
        and Music Engineering to produce the media, and I can envision
        fruitful collaborations with our programs in dance and theater and
        events through the Humanities Center to present our findings to our
        academic community and to the public.
        In the outside community I will seek connections with Ganondagan and
        the Seneca-Iroquois National Museum in Salamanca.
        </p>
        <p>
        I would use the money first to film a series of interviews and
        performance videos at significant sites around ancestral Seneca
        territory: funds will cover fees for Mr. Crouse and other performers,
        professional audio and visual technicians and equipment, and travel,
        so that we can present the songs in the most appealing and engaging
        way we can.
        I will also need to travel funding for archival research: Fenton’s
        papers are at the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia, and
        there are relevant holdings at the New York State Museum in Albany and
        the archives of the University of Buffalo and Syracuse University, as
        well as institutions in Canada.
        I have the technical skills to build the website myself but we will
        need funding for domain registration, hosting, and maintenance.
        For the book we may need funding for image permissions and copy
        editing.  
        We intend to do most of the filming in the summer and work on
        producing the videos and writing the book in academic year 2022–2023,
        with the goal of a finished product by summer 2023.
