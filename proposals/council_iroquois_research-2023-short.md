# Memory and Community in Seneca Earth Songs

Seneca master singer and faithkeeper Bill Crouse, Sr., learned from his
teacher to remember a long cycle of songs by envisioning a line of people
coming forward and seeing each face. Similarly Bill explains Ga’da:šo:t
(Standing Quiver Dance) as originating from a leader calling his men to join a
traveling party and each man in turn contributing a unique song. Singing and
dancing Standing Quiver at the start of a set of                       
Yöëdza’ge:ka’ gaëno’shö’ (Earth Songs) gathers the community and connects them
to this historic chain of dancers. In Esgä:nye’ (New Women’s Shuffle Dance),
Seneca singers invent new songs and store up songs learned from teachers and
friends, preserving genealogies of teaching and shared musical experience over
generations. This paper proposes that Haudenosaunee practices of memory are
inseparably bound to community relationships, and this social memory enabled
the preservation of thousands of songs in oral tradition and makes the songs
powerful conveyers of Haudenosaunee worldview.
