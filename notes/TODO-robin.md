## Questions for Bill

- Dance step video?
- Dance step on last song: do they skip eighths to stay on melodic beat?
- Conception of rhythm on last song (syncopated vs. mixed meters?)
- significance of gender division? (cf. robin couples seen in spring, significance of spring/mating?)
- Johehgoh songs sung in Green Corn?
- what can I say about Green Corn, Changing Rib, Bear Dance?
