  <h2>Vocables</h2>
  <p>
  One other aspect worth examining in these songs is the relationship between the vocables and the musical patterns we have noted.
  The vocables convey the basic rhythms and phrase structure of the songs: repeated words are almost always sung to repeated rhythmic patterns, and recurring groups of words usually signal musical phrases.
  For example, in song 5 <aac:paren>as recorded by the Allegany Singers, <aac:ref type="video" href="#vid:moccasin-score" /></aac:paren>, 
  the words <em>yo:hawiya:h wënö’oyeh</em> are sung four times, marking four distinct musical phrases.
  Though each phrase has different pitches, all feature the same rhythm on these words:

  That same recording provides a chance to examine how how vocables match up with rhythms, because it includes three pairs of songs in which different vocables are sung to the same tune (3 and 4, 5 and 6, 14 and 15).
  In songs 14 and 15, the difference is just between <em>gayowe:</em> and <em>gayowa:</em>, trading one vowel for another to switch from a vocable to the word for moccasin.
  In songs 3 and 4, <em>we:nuye:</em> and <em>ga:yowe:</em> are sung to the same in which the middle syllable is short:
  <aac:inlineMusic type="rhythm-threelines" src="media/moccasin-song3-vocables.png" />.
  In both cases the long, rounded vowels are open and unrounded and the short vowels in the middle are closed and rounded

  That is to say, the <em>relationship</em> 
  between <span class="ipa">/&#603;/</span> and <span class="ipa">/&#117;/</span> 
  is analogous to that 
  between <span class="ipa">/&#593;/</span> and <span class="ipa">/&#111;/</span>.
  Even more speculatively, such phonetic relationships may explain why some vocables are matched to certain melodic patterns: for example in song 1, the melody goes up every time on the fourth syllable of <em>wehanayöge:</em>, perhaps because it seems natural to sing a higher pitch for the closed, nasalized vowel <em>ö</em>.
