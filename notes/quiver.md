# Questions about Standing Quiver

- Is pitch level significant?
    - Are some songs always sung at a high or low pitch level?
    - Does it matter if it varies within a dance or even within a song?
- Is accompaniment always *ga’sä:dö’*?
    - Is accompaniment the right term?
    - Who plays the drum? (Does it matter?)

# To Do

- Need section on terminology and notation in introduction
    - Helmholtz octave notation

# Theory questions

- Scale-degree or solmization notation for speaking about relative pitch?
- Do we need the pc-set notation?
    - Or can we make a standard list of (Messiaen-like) scales and just refer
      to them by number or name?

# Format questions

- Should we have footnotes? (in margins on web?)
- `<aac:pitch pname="A" oct="4" />` vs. `A<aac:oct>4</aac:oct>` vs
  `A<sub>4</sub>` ?
- Music font for accidentals, time signatures, etc. ?
