# Questions about Standing Quiver

- Is pitch level significant?
    - Are some songs always sung at a high or low pitch level?
    - Does it matter if it varies within a dance or even within a song?
- Is accompaniment always *ga’sä:dö’*?
    - Is accompaniment the right term?
    - Who plays the drum? (Does it matter?)
- Is number of repeats fixed?
- How much of song order is fixed?
- How does BC think of song structure (e.g., A, B, A)
- Why did BC choose this selection? Why the differences in song 1?
- Is it coincidence that response on Crouse song 3 = call on Dowdy song 6?
- What is Seneca language in these songs (including Jake version)?
- Thoughts on diff. singing/vocal styles vs. Kyle, Jake?
- Thoughts on degrees of variation, phonemics/phonetics of tunes and vocables

# To Do

- Need section on terminology and notation in introduction
    - Helmholtz octave notation

# Theory questions

- Scale-degree or solmization notation for speaking about relative pitch?
- Do we need the pc-set notation?
    - Or can we make a standard list of (Messiaen-like) scales and just refer
      to them by number or name?

# Format questions

- Should we have footnotes? (in margins on web?)
- `<aac:pitch pname="A" oct="4" />` vs. `A<aac:oct>4</aac:oct>` vs
  `A<sub>4</sub>` ?
- Music font for accidentals, time signatures, etc. ?
- Music examples: YouTube clip audio + SVG or just YouTube clip
- How much text from video teaching to include on website vs. book?
