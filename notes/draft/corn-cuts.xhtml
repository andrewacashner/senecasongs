Lewis Henry Morgan seems to have heard the same story in the mid-nineteenth century, writing that the Three Sisters <q>are supposed to have the forms of beautiful females, to be very fond of each other, and to delight to dwell together</q>;
he explains, <q>This last belief is illustrated by the natural adaptation of the plants themselves to grow up together in the same field, and perhaps from the same hill</q>
<aac:citation key="Morgan:League" pages="161" />.
But contrary to Morganâ€™s typically condescending assumption, plots of corn, beans, and squash growing together are no <q>natural</q> occurrence or accident; this practice is the product of ancient Indigenous ingenuity.
