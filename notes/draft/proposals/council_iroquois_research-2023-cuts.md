Remembering the Standing Quiver songs is a way of remembering the community,
and singing and dancing them actually constitutes the community.
The way Bill teaches about this dance shows that the memory of the song
connects the community today to a long and glorious history of past hunting
parties, war parties, and other adventures.

They also reflect cultural differences from geography and local practice, and
different kinds of engagement with the surrounding culture, including
references to Euro-American popular music.

This oral tradition of Earth Songs has enabled the preservation of thousands
of songs without notation, with some repertories transmitted with little
documented change over the past hundred years and others like the *Ehsgä:nye’*
continuously evolving.
The social concept of memory in songs is also what makes the Earth Songs such
powerful conveyers of Haudenosaunee worldview and values.

This paper proposes that Haudenosaunee practices of memory are inseparably
bound to community relationships---a social memory that multiplies the
infinite memory capacity of a single human brain by the power of the whole
community, across generations.
This oral tradition of Earth Songs has enabled the preservation of thousands
of songs without notation and makes the Earth Songs such powerful conveyers of Haudenosaunee worldview and values.
