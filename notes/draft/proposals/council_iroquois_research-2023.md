# Memory and Community in Seneca Earth Songs

Seneca master singer and faithkeeper Bill Crouse, Sr., tells of his first
experience learning a cycle of some hundred ceremonial songs.
His teacher recorded the songs on cassette tape and gave them to Bill with the
advice to think of each song as the face of a different person coming forward
in a line.
In a similar way, Bill explains the origins of *Ga’da:šo:t* (Standing Quiver
Dance) as beginning with a leader calling his men to join a traveling party by
planting an arrow in the ground, and one by one the other men add their
arrows and contribute a unique song.
Singing and dancing Standing Quiver at the start of a set of 
*Yöëdza’ge:ka’ gaëno’shö’* (Earth Songs) gathers the community and reminds 
them of their history.
The connection between memory and community is even more central in the
*Ehsgä:nye’* (New Women’s Shuffle Dance), in which  Seneca singers invent 
new songs and store up sets of songs learned from teachers, friends, and visitors.
To remember the songs is to preserve genealogies of teaching, learning,
and shared musical experience over multiple generations.
This paper proposes that Haudenosaunee practices of memory are inseparably
bound to community relationships, and this social memory enabled the
preservation of thousands of songs in oral tradition and makes the songs
powerful conveyers of Haudenosaunee worldview.
