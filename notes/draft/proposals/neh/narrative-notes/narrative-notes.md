# motivations:
- decolonization, reappropriation of land and resources
- indigenous self-determination: promote indigenous traditional culture
both to outside world and within indigenous communities
- educate: provide trustworthy information in place of ignorance,
misconceptions, stereotypes
- trace the history of the tradition through recordings, descriptions
going back to Morgan and even to 17C accounts; show that the music has a
history
- write Haudenosaunee music into the history of American music;
demonstrate persistence and continuity through colonization and today;
connect these traditions to others; put them on the same map, part of same
story of music on this land
- on the other hand, tell the story of Haudenosaunee music from an
indigenous perspective, especially its connections to the land and the
whole belief system/way of life of traditional indigenous people. Redraw
the map using native lifeways; reassert the dominance of indigenous
sovereignty over the land and its music
- highlight ways that the tradition is continuing, evolving, changing,
moving into future; connections to other indigneous music-making (e.g.,
intertribal pow-wow)
- celebrate what Seneca people love about this music, why it is important
to them (including aesthetics, social aspects, core values and beliefs,
identity)
- elevate the values of the Great Law and the
political/ethical/theological principles of Haudenosaunee peoples as
embodied in this tradition

# Benefits

- provide material useful for educators, secondary and post-secondary
- show how indigenous music can be included appropriately in an
anticolonial curriculum
- create opportunities for Bill Crouse and other Seneca musicians
(financial, reputational)
- polish the covenant chain; follow the roots to the tree of peace


# Concepts 

- LAND
- RELATIONSHIP, COMMUNITY
- TRADITION, HISTORY

# Challenges, problems
- taboo on sharing ceremonial information; past abuse by scholars
- dangers of colonial thinking in "integrating" ("one map") approach
- how to talk about tradition without putting Indians in either the
eternal present tense or the dead past?
- cultural sensitivity concerns with sharing media
- ethnographic challenge of representing communities scattered in several
polities with differing attitudes

# THEORY

- indigenous theory based in land, reciprocity, relationship, connection
- concepts of history and tradition (and history OF tradition)
- problems of recording, notating, sharing
- problems of methods of teaching (oral tradition, relationship-based, access
  to information controlled)

*perhaps the project should partly be an inquiry into the right way to do the
project maybe better not to act like I've resolved all the questions now*
