    <p><em class="seneca">Gasgoëöda’doh</em> or Shake-the-Bush Dance, also known as Naked Dance, is danced in honor of beans, one of Our Three Sisters,
    just as <a href="corn.html">Corn Dance</a> celebrates corn.
    <!-- what about squash? -->
    This is one of the dances for which tradition allowed women and men to sing together.
