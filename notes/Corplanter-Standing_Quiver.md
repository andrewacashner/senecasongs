Stomp Dance. In other words, the Seneca Standing Quiver Dance. In the old days when the Indians used to go on the warpath and they rest on their march, they stand up their quivers where they rest their arrows, just like the soldiers stack their arms on their marks when they rest.
And as they stand up the quivers in a row, then the leader leads this stomp dance or the Standing Quiver Dance.
