William Fenton (WF) interviews Ed Curry (EC) about *Ga’da:šo:t*

May 15, 1951 "at Quaker Bridge" (?)

APS Mss.Rec. 138.07/05.02

WF: *Ga’da:šo:t* comes from an old Indian word meaning "quiver". Tell us about
that, Mr. Curry.

EC: *Ga’da:šo:t* is the quiver used in the olden days. When they used to
gather, they always carried the quiver, you know. And, they'd gather 'em and
bunch 'em up, in whole, one big stack. Then they'd start this *Ga'da:šo:t* and
they'd dance around this quiver, *ga’dä:shä’t.*

WF: *Ga’dä:shä’t* is the quiver where the arrows go.

EC: Yeah, they'd dance around that. That's the reason they give it the name
*Ga’da:šo:t*.

WF: What about this song that's "They come making a big noise" and "they come
rowing a boat"?

EC: Well, that is probably meant on their way coming on the journey, you know.
Sometimes they come in loud...

WF: Is this a war party coming?

EC: Yes, yes. And they have times to rejoice from day to day and they
take their quivers and they stack them up and start the *Ga’da:šo:t* and dance
around it.
